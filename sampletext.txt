They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election.

The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now!

Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded Chain &amp; Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain.

Must have tough Primary!It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.As I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval.Today it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life.

That's what I said!When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine you can mark it down" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!This story is not about Mr. Khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!Mr. Khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!Wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!Captain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!We crushed the original goal!

It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNewsNATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:https://t.co/VZLDFy707KWow NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!Crooked's stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 - with Bill VP#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaqlWord is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings#CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmBypCrooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes.

His last term as Mayor was a disaster!General John Allen who I never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against ISIS.

She is owned by Wall Street!Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! https://t.co/fUTugI2R2kDeparting now - thank you Cedar Rapids Iowa.

PatheticOur not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8yMany of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkellyI'm with you!

Crazy!Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.Bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/KRCdV77BQpJoin us in Toledo Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGATickets: https://t.co/ERNRrksikq https://t.co/zmGZauCnQFJoin us tomorrow in Scranton Pennsylvania at 3pm!#TrumpPence16 #MAGA Tickets: https://t.co/4FTydj8s9U https://t.co/7zMKhhMmhpPocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was greatFunny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16https://t.co/NOF9Td9BHs https://t.co/WPMBkYjuImThank you Roanoke Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16https://t.co/rwxXhfFsn1 https://t.co/HwqI2iGPDuMAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16https://t.co/4O4yjh7X4O https://t.co/cptBaZbV1v#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/EXsoUOsEP4 https://t.co/3ji7a14GSwGreat POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxDThank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity!

Enjoy! @FoxNewsBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. FraudMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNNOn my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #FITN #Trump2016 https://t.co/oUg1ErD0j7 https://t.co/9Hb7JO3wrZAnybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!.@Morning_Joe  @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowdThe media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honorMy experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place.

Enjoy!I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY!If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $6000000.By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6000000 for VETS.Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation."

Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @gretaThe great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective.

No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose.

Very few listeners - sad!.@BrentBozell one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog.

Wow no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there!Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believableTed Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.

THEY JUST FOUND IT!.@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 &amp; won!Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.Thank you for your support in Biloxi MS! Let's ALL get out &amp; VOTE in 2016 so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/RSZF12KyhnHillary said that guns don't keep you safe.

Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better!Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!.@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night.

Because of his big $ hit ads on me!.@JebBush has spent  $63000000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewittA GREAT day in South Carolina.

Video: https://t.co/yawywElMwaStrange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double &amp; triple them a disaster!Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BADIf Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!Thank you! #Trump2016https://t.co/CE9f0mukFm https://t.co/XNV9Bg2ccYHillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!A new terror warning was issued for European cties.

Weak leaders!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzBCriminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix itThe same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary..@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say "we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!Merry Christmas to all.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundlyThird rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!A great Christmas movie &amp; perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Story: https://t.co/qUpZphfhV3 https://t.co/PSeVbWUJIVHillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign."

I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. LeadWhy does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!The @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. BadThe silent majority- is silent no more!

TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSMNPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #HypocrisyOnce again #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.Jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!Women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rally.VIDEO: https://t.co/yreUny7shA https://t.co/dE9odwIRQi.@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent.Why doesn't @JebBush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate?Will @JebBush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?.@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!Weak and low energy @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.Video from Michigan last night.

AVE. and then being honored by the Wharton School of Finance the BEST!Why are we letting the three girls who left the U.S. to join ISIS back into the country? How stupid has our once respected country become!If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S. a full travel ban will be instituted. This common sense move should have been done long ago!The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!The United States under President Obama has truly become the "gang that couldn't shoot straight." Everything he touches turns to garbage!The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!Negotiation is an art. Treat it like one.Obama will let Ebola fly into US &amp; drugrunners cross our border daily. But he won't pressure Mexico on Sgt. Tahmooressi. #FreeOurMarineOscar Pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend.

Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. If notMexico would pay a price like never before!Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? Perhaps not!14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations. Likewise many other nations. But the U.S. = "COME ON IN"Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. A TOTAL JOKE!Coming soon to Pennsylvania Avenue http://t.co/g4yNUKHUAENow Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama. Of course she did.

There is a guy who has got nothing going a waste!The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again. Nothing works in our once great country anymoreI am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!It is time for the airline pilots flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa. Do it right now!I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted. Little remainsI can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again. He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland.She should never have been so allowed! The real JVWith all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference he didn't say what we all want to hear"I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS"There's nothing like fall in #NewYorkCity.

She supports ObamaCare &amp; opposes 2nd Amendment. Vote for  @Perduesenate to change things!We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies.

Welcome ISIS!If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name it would be the biggest story!Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa.

Their families are up in arms. Not trained.Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming.

My honor.Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister @NewYorkPost @NewYorkObserver &amp; @NashuaTelegraph endorsements!Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice...How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--&amp; his ratings stink.

Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue.In the spirit of transparency Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. http://t.co/eXJyiGeBCongratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article.

A champion!I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star Kevin Garnett @Celtics said to a crowd "Forget Shaq I want to meet Donald Trump."Watch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency http://t.co/02ABDshAI'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC http://t.co/P8yJrMqHThe polls &amp; momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!Fans shouldn't worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOlWhy does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charityGlad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12 the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?Without focus it's just impossible to be successful at anything. --Midas TouchAnother great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama http://t.co/ebUofUW0My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm http://t.co/Lz7tTurDThese last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you! http://t.co/0tf8Pm0nThe Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm--thanks staff!Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others I stayed open. http://t.co/ONelqemCI am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.Because of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.Not only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below move out!If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower call office.Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze. http://t.co/fHVEFZd9We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY not nearly as bad as stated on news.

He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama.I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.What people don't know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont) http://t.co/EMsJd6kPI guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill you are no Letterman.While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct..@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!@BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific!Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.Donald Trump Tells @theblaze About His Obama Announcement: PASSPORT APPLICATIONS TELL YOU A LOT http://t.co/fASvk6gF by @BillyHallowellWatch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer. No one approves (cont) http://t.co/9TTwQFlIIf Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say?If my offer is refused every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!Barack Obama has everything to gain.

Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.By the way where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah....Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? DJTOne of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer &amp; give $1250000 to each family of the four... http://t.co/TMPHmSy7Watch me explain on the @Late_Show how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency http://t.co/UblNbPatA clip from last night's @Late_Show where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades http://t.co/02ABDshA@crushthespirit  True!What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost.

I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants. --The America We DeserveIt is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. EnjoySix days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China" http://t.co/Fe2gkSlg I don't think this was a gaffe.China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports http://t.co/eShZeqgZ  We need @MittRomney to rein them in.Trump Offers To Donate $5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts http://t.co/8l3BpZf6 via @rcpvideo@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.

It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...... By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American peopleRT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records http://t.co/Cn8bn9LH #Election2012I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.My offer to Obama is about transparency.

He has kept Obama in it even with his terrible record.I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping he gave his enemies an opening.70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate.@MittRomney looks much calmer and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight.

I'll be tweeting live.Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden?

CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years he will thank me.

After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate.

We should be given credit for taking this risk.Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters even A-Rod they got you there.While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for CCLast Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media...Bad decisions can be devastating.Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally &amp; aesthetically.Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.Remember new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVFReally enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay.

It's like having your own newspaper.My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period!I still love Derek he is a winner!Remember I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it he broke his foot.At the debate the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.Verlander pitched great but @Yankees look truly defeated.Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. Obama better than last time but again @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debateYou talk tough Mr. President but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done..@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.Obama weak on immigration. All words no action. He's been Prez 4 years.Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk..@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?Why hasn't Obama created jobs?Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!For political purposes only Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road.

And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!Get ready for tonight!@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job..@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi..@washtimes "@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'" http://t.co/CcRkSlHYBetween Libya the national security leaks and Fast &amp; Furious Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President..@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves..@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep..@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing I'll be live tweeting the debateBecause Obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay I'll still keep drinking that garbage.It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit I wish the stuff worked..@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have in my opinion zero talent.I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic my first season winner will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice..@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff gamesI turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!Gov.

TrumpIf @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night Obama is finished!Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications &amp; recordsRomney Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABCOnce again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.No I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go they win.Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont) http://t.co/2rVgPfmoYankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night..@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.Tonight despite everything put A-Rod in the lineup. Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".I told you whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- Warren G. BennisWhen an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. --@PaulRyanVPObama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families.

This will be something special!.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebateDoing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds." Do you believe?There are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still. -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.Wing bangers-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebateBiden's statements on Medicare are very effective.

That is the real scandal.Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero..@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauerStaff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment dealGreat move to take A-Rod out of game.
