Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities
 
(The Watergate Committee) 
 
 

Origins
 
Early on the morning of June 17, 1972, five men broke into the Democratic National 
Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel and office comp
lex in Washington, D.C. A 
security guard alerted the metro police, who arrested the burglars, who carried more than $3500 

in cash and high
-
end surveillance and electronic equipment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
While the burglars awaited their arraignment in federal district cou
rt, the FBI launched an 
investigation of the incident. The dogged reporting of two 
Washington Post
 
journalists, Bob 
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Nixon™s 

reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial in fe
deral district court. The White House denied 
any connection to the break
-
in and in November 1972 President Richard Nixon won reelection in 
a landslide.
 
On January 10, 1973, the trial of the Watergate burglars and two accomplices began. 
After weeks of testi
mony, Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica expressed skepticism that all 
the facts in the case had been revealed. Five men pleaded 
guilty and two were convicted by a 
jury
. Judge Sirica urged those awaiting sentencing to cooperate with the soon

Senate select committee.

Process
 
 
 
On February 5, 1973, Senator Edward Kennedy offered Senate Resolution 60 to establish 
a Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate campaign activities 

related to the presidential election of 1972. Traditionally the sponsoring membe
r presides over an 
inquiry. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wanted to avoid the possibility that the committee 

would seem unduly partisan because of Kennedy™s presidential aspirations, and instead offered 

the chair to Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina. We
ll
-
qualified to head the investigation, 
Senator Ervin was a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, a self
-
proclaimed ﬁcountry 
lawyerﬂ with a degree from Harvard Law School, and widely regarded as the Senate™s 

constitutional expert. At 76 years old he
 
did not aspire to the presidency. His reputation among 
his Senate colleagues was, according to Secretary of the Senate 
Frank Valeo
, ﬁunassailable.ﬂ As 
chairman of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Ervin 

had investi
gated a number of issues important to the Watergate scandal, including surveillance 
and wiretapping.
2
On February 7, 1973, the Senate 
voted unanimously
 
to create the select committee. The 
resolution empowered four Democrats and three Republicans to subpoen
a witnesses and 

materials, provided them with a $500,000 budget, and required them to submit a final report by 
February 28, 1974. The resolution granted the committee the power to investigate the break
-
in 
and any subsequent cover
-
up of criminal activity, a
s well as ﬁall other illegal, improper, or 
 
2
 
 
unethical conduct occurring during the Presidential campaign of 1972, including political 
espionage and campaign finance practices.ﬂ

Public Relations
 
 
 
Emphasizing the educational function of congressional investi
gations, the committee™s 
chief counsel, Samuel Dash, coordinated an aggressive media strategy. The print news media 

focused Americans™ attention on the issue with hard
-
hitting investigative reports, while television 
news outlets brought the drama of the he
arings to the living rooms of millions of American 
households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The Public 

Broadcasting System (PBS) broadcast the hearings during prime time on more than 150 national 

affiliates, earning higher r
atings than regularly scheduled entertainment programming. Only one 
month after the hearings began, an overwhelming majority of Americans
Š
97 percent
Š
had 
heard of Watergate. Of those, 67 percent believed that President Nixon had participated in the 

Watergat
e cover

up.

Investigation
 
 
 
The Senate Watergate committee has been credited with reviving public confidence in 
congressional investigations, which had declined during the McCarthy inquiries of the 1950s. 

Several factors contributed to the committee™s over
all success including extensive media 
coverage, sustained public interest, the meticulous work of investigators, the cooperation of key 

witnesses, and the continuing support of the full Senate. Public support for the investigation 

remained strong even when
 
a series of confrontations between the Watergate committee and the 
White House provoked a constitutional crisis. 
 
Throughout the inquiry President Nixon rebuffed the committee™s requests for access to 
information. Claiming a constitutional separation of p
owers, he refused to allow his aides to 
testify. Senator Ervin insisted that executive privilege could not be extended to cover criminal 

behavior and he threatened to authorize the sergeant at arms to arrest White House aides who 

refused to testify.
5
Chairman
 
Ervin requested access to the tapes, b
elieving that they would either 
corroborate or repudiate testimony that the president had knowledge of, and approved efforts to 

cover up, the Watergate break
-
in. 
Senate Resolution 194
 
authorized the committee to ﬁissue 
subpoenas for documents, tapes and ot
her material to any officer of the executive branch,ﬂ and 
the committee 
subpoenaed the tapes
. Nixon 
refused to comply
, citing executive privilege and 
separation of powers. 
Senator
 
Ervin rebutted that ﬁthe select committee is exercising the 
constitutional p
ower of the Senate to conduct the investigation, and the doctrine of the separation 
of powers of Government requires the President to recognize this and to refrain from obstructing 

the committee.ﬂ Vice Chairman Howard Baker (R
-
TN) proposed that the committ
ee take the 
president to court. On August 9, 1973, the committee took the unprecedented step of 
suing the 

president
 
in federal district court for access to the tapes and other documents. The court 
dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction and appeals a
ffirmed the lower court™s ruling.
 
Conce
ding to public pressure, the president allowed his aides to cooperate but 
continued to deny the committee access to presidential papers. Nixon repeatedly declared that he 

knew nothing about the Watergate burglary, but one former aide testified that the pre
sident had 
approved plans to cover up White House connections to the break
-
in. Another aide revealed that 
the president maintained a voice
-
activated tape recorder system in various rooms in the White 
House.

In early 1974 Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski asked the committee to postpone 
releasing its final report so as to not unduly influence the criminal cases he was preparing against 
former White House staff. The House Judi
ciary Committee launched an impeachment inquiry. In 
light of these developments, members of the Senate committee voted unanimously on February 

19, 1974, to conclude public hearings and complete the committee™s remaining tasks in private 

sessions.
7
Outcome
 
 
 
 
The committee submitted its 
final report
 
including legislative recommendations on June 
27, 1974. On July 24 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 
a separate case, 
United States v. 

Nixon
,
 
that the president must surrender the tapes to the special prosecutor. President Nixon 
complied and the recordings revealed that he had approved a plan to cover up the White House 

connection to the Watergate burglary. Based on this evidence, the House Jud
iciary Committee 

adopted three articles of impeachment. Before the full House could vote, 
Nixon resigned
 
on 

August 9, 1974.
8
The Watergate committee™s final report recommended legislative action in three areas: 
regulation of campaign activities and contributions; the establishment of a permanent special 

prosecutor; and the creation of a permanent congressional legal service. Som
e, though not all, of 
these recommendations became law. In 1974 Congress amended the 
Federal Election Campaign 

Act
. The revisions imposed limitations on expenses and contributions, required regular reporting 
by election committees, and established a means 
for public financing of presidential nominating 
conventions and primary elections. Congress passed the 
Ethics in Government Act
 
in 1978. The 
bill required financial disclosure by executive and judicial branch officials and established the 

Office of Governm
ent Ethics as an oversight agency. It also created mechanisms for the 
appointment of a special prosecutor.
 
 
 
 
In the years following the Watergate investigation Congress passed legislation aimed at 
strengthening the legislative branch™s oversight powers. In 1
974 Congress overrode a 

presidential veto and revised the 
Freedom of Information Act
, providing the public and the 
media with new tools to access information held by the executive branch.  The 1976 
Government 

in Sunshine Act
 
required federal agencies to ho
ld their meetings in public. 
 
The Senate Watergate investigation remains one of the most significant congressional 
inquiries in U.S. history. Over the course of this 16 month investigation committee members 

maintained bipartisan accord, garnered public sup
port, and expanded congressional investigatory 

powers to produce lasting legislative reform.
