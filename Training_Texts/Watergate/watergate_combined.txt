Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140061-1 WASHINGTON POST 18 April 1973 0 By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Weshfncton Poat staff writers President Nixon announced.yester= day that there were "major develop- ments" in, . the.Watergate case and, in a reversal of .his earlier position,- he has agreed to allow his aides to testify; under oath before a Senate committee that is investigating the,affair. The President said he personally "be- gan intensive new inquiries into this whole matter" on March 21 and that "real progress has been made in find- ing the truth." Where previously the President had stated that ? no members of the Write :House staff were involved in the bug- ging of Democratic headquarters, yes, terday he told reporters: "If any person in the executive ,branch' or in the government is in- dicted by the grand jury, my policy will be to immediately suspend him. 'If he is convicted, he will of course,, be automatically discharged." The President's statement was in sharp contrast to 10 months of White I-louse denials of involvement of presi-. dential aides in the Watergate bugging and other ,political espionage and sabo-? tage activities. ? Following Mr. Nixon's brief talk, presidential press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler met.-with reporters and said that all previous White House state-. ments about the bugging were "inoper- ative." Ziegler emphasized: "The Presi-, dent's statement today is the operative statement." Meanwhile, reliable g o v e r n m e n t sources said yesterday that two or three former presidential aides and ad- ministration officials are .currently the focus of the Justice Department's crim- inal investigation and will probably be ,indicted by the federal grand jury in-, vestigating the Watergate espionage. At the same time, White house and Justice Department sources said de- velopments in the case are likely to lead to the resignation of at least two, high White House officials believed by the President to be either directly or indirectly responsible for the Water- gate bugging and other political cspio- ?nage and sabotage. ' One White House aide Said yesterday that the President's language about the possible indictment of persons in the executive branch was carefully chosen and based on knowledge of im- pending indictments. Until yesterday, the President was adamant In. his refusal to allow his aides to testify before a "formal ses- sion" of a congressional committee. He said last month they had "executive privilege" to refuse to disclose confi- dential White House business, and that lie would welcome a court test on the issue. The Senate Watergate committee, led by its chairman. Sen. Sam J. Ervin 'gi kc~ n r Jr. (D-N.C.), was just as insistent in de- manding that presidential aides testi fy under oath and in public. Ervin, said that executive privilege 'could not be invoked in investigations ,of wrongdoing and threatened to ar- rest presidential aides and try them for oontempt of the Senate. if they re- ? fused 'subpoenas. "All members of the White House staff will appear voluntarily when re- quested by the committee," the Presi- dent said yesterday. "They will testify under oath and they will answer fully all proper questions." Mr. Nixon said that his 'aides could still invoke execu- tive privilege-but only on individual questions. Ervin has not disputed this. The President presented his state- ment during a meeting with reporters. It followed weeks of demands by lead- ing Republicans that he speak out about the Watergate and came on a day when the Los Angeles Times re- ported that the President was about to make a dramatic admission of high- level responsibilty for the Watergate- type espionage. ? The first reaction by Republicans to ,the ]resident's statement was favor- able. Sen. Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.), the vice chairman of the Senate invest- igating committee, said of Mr. Nixon's announcement, "We now have the biggest hurdle behind us.' "I'm highly pleased with the Presi- dent's decision," Baker said, "I think it was a good one. I can't resist saying that I've always contended that we - would have White House aides testify, along with everyone else who known anything about this matter. I aifi de- lighted that that optimism now seems' justified. The President has made the determination to re-evaluate the entire. situation, and I commend him for it.". Mr. Nixon said he began his own in- vestigation March 21 "as a result of serious charges which came to my at., tention." ' Ziegler said the President was re-- ferring in part to sworn testimony by" Watergate conspirator James W. Mc- Cord, who has said superiors told him' that at least three presidential asso-. ciates had advance knowledge of the Watergate bugging: former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, presidential: counsel John W. Dean III and former presidential assistant Jeb Stuart Ma- gruder. now a Commerce Department official. Ziegler repeatedly refused to discuss the possibility of whether individual members of the White House staff were involved in the bugging or whether they plan to resign. On num- erous occasions he refused to discuss specific inquiries about Dean, who con- ducted an investigation for President Nixon that cleared all then-current members of the White House staff of involvement in the bugging. He added that since March 21, the President has conducted White House r gate,-, sistance of Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen, who has headed the Justice Department's criminal investi- gation of the Watergate casd. Ziegler. indicated yesterday that Dean had effectively been removed from any further assignment to in- vestigate the Watergate case, stating, that the President "felt it was not ap- propriate that any member of the White House staff be involved in fur- ther investigation." Earlier, the President had told re- porters that he met Sunday with Peter- sen and Attorney General Richard G. Kleindierist."to review the facts which had come to me in my investigation and also to review the progress of the, Department of Justice investigation." Mr. Nixon added: "I can report today that there have been major develop- ments in the case concerning which it would be improper to be more specific now, except to say that real progress has been made in finding the truth." The President then announced that he will suspend any person in the ex- ecutive branch who might be indicted in the case. "I have expressed to the appropriate authorities my view that no individual holding, in the past or at present, a position of major importance in the ad- .ministration should be given immunity from prosecution," the President said. Ziegler told reporters that the Presi- dent has had "extensive discussions ,with members of the (White House) staff about the situation," but stressed. that Mr. Nixon.now "has looked to Mr. Petersen"-not his own staff-to assist in further investigation. Ziegler was repeatedly asked if he stood by his earlier denials that Dean and White House chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman had advance knowl- edge of the Watergate bugging. He de-' clined to answer on grounds that he. would not discuss individuals. When asked specifically about the President's Aug. 29 statement that no* one then on the White House staff was involved in the Watergate mat- ter, Ziegler said, "That was a state- ment prior to today's . . ?. The state- ment today is the operative state- ment.". When pressed on the reliability of his own statements, Ziegler said they were based on information available at the time, prior to when the Presi- dent . began his own "intensive new inquiries into this whole matter." Ziegler was reminded that Presi- dent- Nixon called White House coup= sel Dean on March 26, and expressed confidence in him. Ziegler, on the same day, had said that Deab was innocent of any involvement in the Watergate bugging. Asked if he stands behind his statement, Ziegler said: Approved For Re ase 28u1)'0'8/6 "ebFth t- 09432R000100140001-~1 a "Pe 01. >ne .  Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140001-1 President's 'statement, It would ' be in- appropriate for me to discuss any indi- vidual." Asked whether the White House, duties of either Haldeman or Dean had been altered because of recent developments in the Watergate case, Ziegler said: "'I'm not going to focus on any individual today" and warned reporters that "my refusal to do so should not imply anything." Later, the press secretary said `that , "everyone in the White House staff is in their jobs as previously," and that their duties remain unchanged ex- cept for the President's directive that no 11'h6. ]louse aides be involved in further investigation of the Watergate case. Ziegler refused to say whether the 'President's statement about possible ,criminal action against members of the executive branch applied only to .the. Watergate bugging or to related allegations of widespread political es- pionage and sabotage activities as well.

"It's wishful thinking on their part if they think they can get away with that," the asso- ciate said. Another associate described Dean's statement that he will not be a scapegoat as "just the first salvo from John." In its editions yesterday, The Washington Post report- ed that former presidential assistant Magruder had pro., vided federal prosecutors with a first-hand account of a Feb-~ ruary, 1972, meeting in then-I Attorney General Mitchell's office to discuss and approve the bugging operation at the Watergate. Those who attend. ed the meeting were Mitchell, Dean, Magruder and convict. Ad Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy, according to several sources' accounts of Magruder's statements to the prosecutors. Yesterday, one associate of Dean said the presidential counsel had confirmed that he attended such a meeting at which the bugging was dis- cussed, but contended that Dean argued against the it- leral eavesdropping operation and refused to have anything to do with it. Afterwards, the associate said, Dean was. ordered by su- periors in the White House to handle arrangements for pay- ing the seven indicted Water- gate conspirators to remain silent. R1ag.uder, according to White House sources, has said that both Dean and Mitchel made the arrangements to buy, the conspirators' silence is ,addition to approving plans for ,the bugging. Mitchell, asked in New York about yesterday's story in The Post, told' the Associated Press: "This gets a little sillier as it goes along, doesn't it? I've had a good night's sleep and haven't heard any of this non- sense." Magruder, the deputy direcc- tor of the Nixon re-election campaign, was scheduled to testify yesterday before the federal grand jury investigat.- ing the case, but reporters at the U.S. Courthouse did not see him there. Federal prose- cutors last night refused to discuss whether Magruder had appeared before the grand jury, or when he is scheduled to testify. It is known that, in addition to the bugging itself, the grand jury is investigating al- legatlons of obstruction of justice and perjury by pres- ent and former presidential aides. Meanwhile, Washington at- torney Peter H. Wolf added new mystery to the Watergate investigation yesterday by say. ing that a client of his had taken eight cartons of mater. ials from convicted Watergate conspirator Hunt's office the day after the Watergate break-1 in last June and had held on to them until just before thel election. Wolf said, that included in, the boxes were the "plans to 'bug' the Watergate" as well as contributors' lists that were later "turned over by the Com- mittee (for the Re-election of ,the President) in the litigation instituted by Common Cause." In his motion filed in U.S. District Court, Wolf said he was attempting to determine whether he has a lawyer-client' relationship or whether he must testify before the grand jury. Wolf did not identify his client, other than to say he "worked for the Committee for Re-election of the Presi- dent." The lawyer also did not dis- close who had given his client the orders to pick up the ma- terials-and hide them. Wolf said the client had come to him to ask "whether he was in danger 'of violating 'any law if he'had hidden in his possession approximately eight cardboard cartons con- taining, among other things, the contents of Hunt's desk in the White House before the FBI got there, including plans to 'hug' the Watergate." The attorney said he hall urged his client to "turn over these documents to people conducting investigations of. the Watergate matter." Wolf said that his client came to him late last summer and "very shortly after this I telephoned principal assistant U.S. Attorney Earl J. Silbert and received from him an opinion that he did not think my client was commit- ting any crime." Silbert responded yesterday that Wolf's motion was "pre- posterous." Silbert said Wolf's "implication that evidence of this nature would be ignored (by me) is incredible." Silbert said the conversa- tion last summer involved the propriety of Wolf's client turn- ing over materials relevant to the Common Cause suit and that no mention was made of where the materials came from. "It was only a few days ago that Dlr. Wolf disclosed to us that his anonymous client had obtained t h e s e, documents from llr. Hunt's office," Sil- bert said. I Wolf said his client "had' been asked" by an unnamed' party to pick up the cartons from Hunt's office in the Ex- ecutive Office Building and ,,that a pass would be waiting for him at the guard entrance, that no questions would be' asked when the cartons were; removed from the building,, and none were." Hunt's attorney, William O.! Bittman, said yesterday that, Hunt ,to the best of my knowledge, didn't have any documents in his office except' in the. safe." He said he was unaware of Wolf's allegations. In another. development, 'an aide to Sen. Lowell P. I Weicker, Jr., (R-Conn.) said yesterday that a locked filing cabinet in his (the aide's) of- fice containing records of In- vestigations into the Water gate case and related matters Washington Post 11 April 1973 Lost Put' at, 86o2 Efli'loon Associated Press Sen. William Proxmire (D- Wis.) said yesterday the U.S. intelligence community em- ploys about 148,000 persons and spends about $6.2 billion each year. Renewing his call for dras- tic cuts In the cost of Ameri. can spying and covert activi- ties overseas, Proxmire urged James Schlesinger, new Cen- Atral Intelligence Agency Dl- Irector, to make public the gov- ernment's entire intelligence budget, which has always been secret. Proxmire said he Is not op- posed to a first-rate American intelligence operation but does believe that the Intel ligenee establishment has swollen out of proportion tol national defense needs and that congressional controls and restraints on it have eroded. . He said his cost and man. Power estimates are not based on classified or official sources and noted that they, apparently was opened during the night. William Wickens, a counsel. to Weicker, said it was impos sible to determine immedi- ately whether anything was missing from the cabinet but; that it was possible 'some of the records might have been. Photographed or copied. A Xe-i rox machine is located about 51 feet from the cabinet, Wickens! -said. depict the CIA as smaller iii' both personnel 'and budget than at least three other U.S. intelligence groups. Proxmire's estimates show the CIA with a work force of 15,000 and an annual budget of $750 million. These are his, other estimates: National Security Agency, 20,000 and $1 billion; Defense Intelligence Agency, 5,016 and $100 million; Army Intelli- gence, 38,500 and $775 million; Navy Intelligence, 10,000 and $775 million; Air Force Intelli- gence, 60,000 and $2.8 billion, and State Department Intelli- gence, 335 and $8 million. Proxmire said his estimates are "not without' error," but nevertheless are "in the ball- park." "These figures do not re- flect, however, the coordina- tion that is involved from one organization to another," Proxmire said. "The Air Force, for example, supplies the launch boosters and satel- lites for the highly successful reconnaissance program and this is one reason the budget. is so high." Proxmire has said . previ.' ously that secret missions by intelligence agencies overseas are needlessly Involving the United States In the political affairs of other countries at a period when the need for the missions has been greatly re- duced by modern techniques of electronic and aerial sur- veillance.

In related developments yesterday: ? Three principal figures in an alleged campaign:of politi- cal espionage and sabotage conducted against the Demo- crats appeared before the same grand jury as McCord yesterday. They are former presidential appointments see-' retary Dwight L. Chapin, for- mer White House aide Gordon Strachan. and alleged political saboteur Donald II. Segretti. 111 ? Reliable investigative sources said that Mitchell and iformer commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans, the chief Nixon campaign fund-raiser, appeared earlier this month before a federal grand jury in New York City investigat him final typed transcripts of wiretapped conversations on several occasions and said; "These are for. the (former) at- torney general.", On at least one occasion. McCord report- edly 'testified, Liddy specifi cally told him that he regu- larly "hand-carried" the tran- scripts to Mitchell, who was then President Nixon's cam- paign manager. On another occasion, Mc- Cord reportedly testified, he saw Liddy's secretary, Sally Harmony,.typing a final ver slon of the transcripts from' MrC ord's own preliminary' draft. One source familiar with the testimony said yesterday: "If those conversations were being retyped, it meant they had to he going somewhere; Liddy certainly didn't need to have them typed again for himself."} Miss Harmony. who testified before the Watergate grand year, has been contacted by the Senate select committee investigating the bugging of Democratic headquarters and other political espionage and sabotage, and is expected to be recalled before the grand jury as well. . ,McCord also reportedly told the grand jury that the Water, gate hugging team had plan- ned to install wiretapping and eavesdropping devices at Sen. McGovern's headquarters dur- ing the same weekend that he and four other conspirators were arrested at the Water- ate. The operation at the ontainebleu, he reportedly, testified, was still in the plan ning stages and Liddy told him.that it would be executed as soon as word came from Mitchell. McCord is also known to have told others that the bug- ging team had,planned to wire- tap the campaign headquar- ters ` of : Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) during the spring, but that the plans were; abandoned when' it was clear that Muskie was no longer the front-runner for the Demo- cratic presidential nomination. It could ? not be learned if ? Mc-. Cora who rented an office. next door to Muskie headquar- ters in Washington mentioned that matter to the grand jury.: Like his earlier testimony before the Senate's select in- vestigating committee, Mc- Cord's grand jury statements about the. alleged involvement in wiretapping activities of presidential aides and advisers was based on hearsay-prima- rily in the form' of what he says he was told by Liddy. Liddy has been sentenced to an additional prison term for contempt of court in refusing to answer the grand jury's questions, including those based on what he is saiti to have told McCord. 'The meaning of the appear- ance ance by former presidential appointments secretary ' Cha- pin, former White House aid Strachan and alleged agent provocateur Segretti before the Watergate grand jury yes- terday was not immediately clear, One federal source said their appearance is the first indica- tion that the grand jury inves- tigation may have moved be- vond illegal electronic surveil- lance to include a broad range of political espionage and sab- otage activities. Previously, the Justice Department has main- tained that there was nothing Illegal about the' operations Segretti and Chapin were al- legedly involved in. Some federal sources sug- gested yesterday that Chapin and Segretti were called be- fore the grand jury to estab- lish that they have no knowl- edge of illegal electronic sur- veillance. - tors took unusual steps to pre- vent news reporters from ob- serving who was to appear be-, fore the panel. The prepara-; tions included moving the; grand jury to a different room, accessible from two entrances,' one of which is reachable 'through a hack elevator. ' Assistant U.S, Attorney Earl J. Silbert, who heads the re- newed federal investigation into the Watergate bugging and related matters, said the new arrangements were order- ed because a circus atmos- ,phere had developed outside the other grand jury room, -where reporters have gathered in the last two weeks to watch persons entering and leaving. Despite the new arrange- ments, reporters were able to tdetermine that Chapin was) in the grand jury room for 'about 90 minutes, after which the scurried past reporters, smiling but refusing to answer any questions. Outside the courthouse, he ,entered a brown sports car and sped away. Segretti, who followed him into the closely guarded grand jury room, was there for about. 45 minutes before the grand jury quit for the day at about 5:45 p.m. Prosecu- 1tors refused to say whether Segretti would return for more questioning. It could not be determined how long Strachan, a former political aide to White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman, was before the grand jury. . According to investigators, Chapin and Strachan both played a, role in hiring Segret- ti to engage in political dis- ruption and spying activities. Chapin, according to FBI reek ords made public, also made arrangements for Segretti to he paid by President Nixon's personal lawyer, Herbert W. -Kalmbach, and Strachan al- legedly put Watergate con- spirator Liddy in touch with Segretti to merge two nom- inally separate spying-and- sabotage operations: one run by the White House and the other by the Committee for the Re-election of the 'Presi- dent. Another witness to appear before the grand jury yester- day teas Robert Reisner, a for. mer aide to Jeh Stuart Magru. der, the deputy director of the Nixon re-election, campaign. Reisner, who has also been contacted by the Senate's in- vestigating committee, was presumably before the grand jury yesterday to be asked about McCord's hearsay alle~ gations that . Magruder was among high presidential asso- ciates who had advance knowl- edge of the Watergate hug- ging.

Reisner was expected to he asked by prose. cutors yesterday about some of the leads provided by Mc- Cord. Both Senate and Justice De- partment investigators have confirmed that Mitchell, Dean, Liddy and Magruder were all present during a February meeting in Mitchell's office but have thus far have unable to substantiate that the bug- ging was discussed, WASHINGTON POST 11 April 1973 1M iEteUU Aide $70,000 Of Bug Fund By Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein Waahinaton Pont Staff Writers About $70,000 in cash from President Nixon's campaign i was transferred in apparent violation of the law last July to a principal assistant of ::or- mer Attorney General John N. Mitchell, according to reliable investigative sources. The $70,000-mostly in $100 bills-came from the same ac- count that financed the Water- ' gate bugging and went to for- mer White House aide Fred- crick C. LaRue, one of Mitch- ;ell's closest political aides, the sources said. The purpose of the traimmfer is not yet known, the sources said, but federal investigators are expected to try to deter- mine if the $70,000 was in any way used to pay the Watergate conspirators for their silence, LaRue received the $70.000 two weeks after the arrest of five men June 17 in the De:.no- crats' Watergate headquarters and several days after Mich- ell resigned as the President's campaign manager, the sources said. The transfer was approved by former Commerce Secre- tary Maurice H. Stags, the fi- nance chairman of the Nixon campaign, according to sworn testimony given this month to federal investigators in Now York City. A spokesman for the Cam- mittee for the Re-election of the President, reached yester- DeVan L. Shumway, spokes- man for the Nixon re-election committee, said yesterday that Mitchell does not recall such a February meeting, and, that Mitchell first met Liddy on June 15, 1972, at least three months after - the alleged meeting.' In'seeking corroboration of McCorci's testimony, Senate. sources said yesterday that staff members of the select ,committee have talked to Vicki IChern, Reisner,s secretary at the Nixon committee, and that she provided an appointment book or calendar confirming a scheduled meeting of Mitch- ell, Dcan, Liddy and Magru- der in February. Miss Chern is also under stood to have provided the, committee staff with other in- formation. However, reliable Senate sources discounted pub- lished reports that the com- mittee:.has fours, ai witness who can confirm that the bug-, ging was discussed at the meeting. day afternoon, had no im- mediate comment on the re- port of $70,000 fund. Mitchell, Stans and LaRue could not be reached for comment. The testimony concerning the $70,000 transfer is the first indication that the President's re-election committee contin- ued to maintain a secret ac- count of some sort after the arrests in the Watergate. The General Accounting Of- fice was 'not told of the trans- fer, as required by the new Federal Election Campaign Act, which directs full public accounting of all campaign money after April 7, 1972. Philip S. Hughes, head of the Federal Elections Office in the GAO, responded yester- day ; to an inquiry about the $70,000 by saying: "It seems that the law is loud and clear that all money, in their hands. after April 7 had 'to be fully accounted for. If ti>is money went out in July -and I've never heard of it befdre-I don't think any rea- songble person could argue that, it was not a violation- even Stags hasn't argued, that:-" The $70,000 came from a Tart cash fund that was kept in Stans' office safe and was used to finance a broad cam- pai,,1n of political espionage and 'sabotage. That intelligence-gathering fund, which fluctuated in size between $350,000 and $700,000,' was, the source of at least $235,000 for convicted Water- gate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy, the former finance counsel to the Nixon commit. tee. P In January, the Nixon com- mittee pleaded no contest to eight separate violations of. the new campaign finance dis-' closure law stemming from) the;paYments to Liddy and was'fined $8,000. According to -two sources at thelNixon committee, the $70,- 000- was given to LaRue for noncampaign purposes that are apparently known only to Mitchell, LaRue and other top campaign officials. LaRue was one of two per- sons directed by former Attor-1 ner General Mitchell to keeps the.'public and federal investi- gatitirs from learning many de- tails about the Nixon commit- tee~ involvement in the Watergate bugging, according to llighly placed sources in the Nixon campaign., Meanwhile, federal inve,t H gators in Washington are known to be checking into testimony of convicted Water-1 gate conspirator James W. McCord Jr. that he received: $3,000 a month from the late' wife of coconspirator and for-, mer White House consultant ,E. Howard Hunt Jr. According to reliable sources, McCord received the money in cash-mostly $100 bills-in exchange for 'his si- lence about the Watergate op- ' eration. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Nixon com- mittee, reportedly testified be- fore a federal grand jury here that Dorothy I-Iunt told him ,last year that the $3,000 a month and $1,000 monthly pay. .ments to other conspirators came from the Nixon re-elec- lion committee under an ar- rangement worked out by Kenneth W. Parkinson, the committee's attorney. Parkinson has denied the charge and said it is "totally and completely false." According to sworn testi- mony given to federal investi- gators in New York City, La-' Rue received the money from Hugh W. Sloan Jr., the former. Nixon committee treasurer who resigned abdut the time of the July transfer. The testimony by campaign', committee officials was made to a federal grand jury in New York . City investigating a $200,000 cash contribution to t the Nixon committee by finan- cier Robert L. Vesco. Vesco is charged in a civil! suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission with misappropriating $224 million in mutual funds man- aged by IOS, Ltd., a financial complex based in Switzerland. According to other federal sources, the $200,000 Vesco contribution went into the ocash fund kept in Stags' safe. That fund has been a cen- tral focus of the Watergate in- vestigation and has the follow. ing history: In August, the GAO cited the Nixon committee for 11 apparent violations of the law for failing to report receipts and expenditures from the i fund, which the GAO at the t time said contained at least I$350.000. In ,May, after the new 1$350,000 was deposited in th !bank, apparently liquidatin the fund. determined that at least $12, 000 from the fund (part of th $235,000) was given to th liquidated on May 25. checks, including $89,000 i Mexican checks taken acros the border to conceal th ' utors, went into the cash fund. The checks were cashed by bank'account last April. 0 At least $30,000, whit Donald H. Segretti, an alleged against the Democratic presi dential candidates. Th money was paid to Segretti b Herbert W. Kalmbach, Presi- dent Nixon's personal attor- ney, at the direction of former presidential appointments sec- retary Dwight L. Chapin. O Disbursements from the fund were, according to fed- eral sources, controlled by Mitchell, Stags, Kalmbach, Jeb Stuart Magruder (the No. 2 of- ficial at the Nixon campaign) and White house chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman. The White House has denied that Haldeman controlled disburse. ments from the fund. Hughes, head of the federal elections-office, said yesterday that officials from the Nixon committee have declined to say how much money was in the fund. Reliable sources have said that the fund con- tained close to $1 million. LaRue, once the part owner of a gambling casino in Las Vegas, has been one 'of the most enigmatic figures of the Nixon administration's inner circle since the President took office. During the 1972 cam- paign, he was one of the most important presidential aides placed by the White House in the leadership of the Commit. tee for the Re-election of the President. A wealthy Jackson, Miss., oil man, LaRue was.one of the ar- chitects of the "Southern' Strategy" of the 1968 Nixon) campaign, in which he worked as an assistant to campaign manager iitchell. During the first three years of the Nixon administration, he officially served as a coun- sel to the President, although his name was never listed In the White'House staff. directo- ries, and some lower-level "White House aides still say: "I never heard of him when he was over here."

' Both La Rue and Magruder played roles in the Nixon cam- paign's program of espionage and sabotage activities against the Democrats, . according to campaign and Investigative sources. At the committee, the two shared an office suite and, among campaign Insid- ers, became collectively. known as "MagRue." Magruder has denied alle- gations in hearsay testimony by Watergate conspirator Mc- Cord that he was one of sev- eral former presidential asso- ciates who had a d v a n c e knowledge of the Watergate bugging. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Nixon re-election committee, is known to have told investi- gators that he has no knowl- edge that LaRue was involved lin the bugging. According to Alfred C. Bald win III, the ex-FBI agent and WASHINGTON POST Mitchell security guard who monitored the wiretapped con- versations of Democrats at the Watergate, his hiring by .the 'Nixon committee was person. Ally approved by LaRue. Bald- win, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, said he was supplied with a gun by LaRue, who told him not to worry about not having a li- cense. 11 At the time of the Water- gate arrests on June 17, Mitch: ell, Magruder, LaRue and Robert C. Mardian, former As- sistant Attorney General, were all together on the West Coast, according to investiga- tive and Nixon committee sources. Mitchell reportedly ordered Magruder to fly di- rectly back to Washington on Sunday, June 18, to investi- gate the situation. Then 'Mitchell returned to Washington with LaRue and Mardian on Monday or Tues- day, and designated them as coordinators of the Nixon committee's response to the bugging, including responsibil- ity for dealing with federal in- vestigators. Part of that response, ac- cording to Investigators, was a massive "housecleaning" or- dered by LaRue and Mardian, in which numerous records were destroyed. Mardian also sat in on almost all FBI inter- j'views with Nixon committee employees and, with LaRue, reportedly advised some per- sons to "stay away from cer? twin areas" in their discussions with investigators. the conspiracy. On one, or more occasions, .McCord reportedly testified, .11Irs. Hunt told him she flew to Miami to pay. those de tfendants while they were awaiting trial. In January,' -Frank A. Sturgis, one of the. Miami men, was quoted in The New York Times as say- ';ing the four were still being ',paid but would not say who was supplying the cash. McCord, according to the' ?.sources, testified that Mrs. 'Hunt had become increasingly `disturbed about her role in al- vlegedly paying off the defend- rants to keep silent, and dis- ,`cussed the matter with him on tseveral occasions. 'McCord reportedly told the grand jury that Mrs. Huntap ;geared certain that the money kwas coming from the re-elec- ition committee, either directly or indirectly through Parkin- ,:son. On several occasions, Mc- 'Cord is said to have told the ,grand jury, Mrs. Hunt told shim that the arrangements for the payoffs had been made through Parkinson. During the Watergate trial, Hunt and the four Miami men pleaded guilty to all the, charges against them. McCord and his principal superior in f the conspiracy, former White House aide G. Gordon Liddy, were convicted without taking the witness stand. Liddy has continued to remain silent, since his conviction and has received an additional prison sentence for contempt of court after refusing to answer a grand jury's questions. At the time the four Miami men pleaded guilty, sources close to those defendants re- ported that each had been receiving $1,000 a month since their arrest and that Hunt had promised them they would continue to receive the money if they followed his lead and pleaded guilty. Hunt, a for- mer White House consultant, told the men they would even- tually be granted executive clemency if they remained silent, according to the sources. The sources said they were aware of how the $1,000 a month was being distributed but refused to disclose the details. Parkinson, the principal at- torney for the Committee for the Re-election of the Presi- dent, is a partner in the Washington law firm of Jack- son, Laskey & Parkinson. Last October, Alfred C. Baldwin III, the ex-FBI agent and Nixon committee security guard who monitored the wiretapped conversations of Democrats in their headquar-, ters at the Watergate, told The Los Angeles Times that Park- inson inson had urged him to take the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury investigating the case. Justice Dcpartment. sources said at the time that! they could not substantiate the allegation by Baldwin, who cooperated with the prosecution and became a key government witness in the case. , Parkinson, 45, graduated inl* 1952 from the George Wash-i ington University Law School. 10 April 1973 MCord: `lush' Money Came From Hunt's Wife By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward wnshinaton Post 9tnff writers Watergate conspirator James W. McCord Jr. has tes- tified before a federal grand jury that Ire received $3,000 a month from the late wife of his coconspirator, E. Howard Hunt Jr., to remain silent about his role in the bugging .of Democratic headquarters, according to reliable sources. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Committee for the Re-election of the Pres- ident, reportedly testified that Dorothy L. Hunt told him the $3,000a month carne from the re-election committee under an arrangement worked out by Kenneth W. Parkinson, the committee's attorney. Parkinson called the charge "totally and completely false.'- Tlunt's attorney, William O. liittman, declined to cony ment, saying he had no in- formation to either confirm or deny the substance of AIc- Cord's allegations. McCord reportedly testi- fied that Mrs. Hunt, who was killed in an airplane crash in Chicago last December, told' him she usually received Nix on committee money from an intermediary for Parkinson and that she then distributed' the cash to the Watergate de- fendants. At the' time of her, death,' Mrs. Hunt was carrying $10,- 01)0 in $100 bills, which D'Ic- Cord reportedly testified was part of a payoff to her hus-, band for remaining silent. about the Watergate conspir-acy ATcCord said Mrs. Hunt was taking the money to Chi- cago to invest it in a motel, according to reliable sources. Hunt also has said the money was for investment purposes. According to sources famil- iar with McCord's grand jury testimony, he said he was told by Mrs. Hunt that- she was also paying four other defend- ants in the case-the Miami men arrested inside the 1\'atcrgate with McCord on June 17 - $1,000 per month each to remain silent about He has been active in Legal Aid and, Neighborhood Legal Services programs here. Meanwhile, L a w r e n c e Young, the California attorney who first disclosed the contact between alleged political sabo- teur Donald H.' Segretti and the White House, charged yes- terday that there is an at- tempt to "muzzle" him. Young said he had received a letter from Segretti's attor- (ncy warning that any commu-1 nications between Young and' Segretti are covered by a law- yer-client privilege of confi= rdentiality "and are not to be discussed by you under any. circumstances." Young denied a lawyer- client relationship with See retti and said he views the at- tempt to keep him quiet as an' indication that Segretti will refuse to cooperate .with the Senate select committee inves- tigation the Watergate bug-. ging and related allegations of, political espionage and sabo- tage. Young said the letter from ,Segretti's lawyer was dated April 4, two weeks after an in-; vestigator from the select' committee had asked Young for additional information about Scgretti. The letter, which Young said was signed by John P. Pollock, a Los Angeles attor- ney for Segretti, told Young that he was not to discuss any- thing regarding Segretti's "actions, persons with whom he' was associated, places where he traveled and all other aspects of his work." Last fall Young told The Washington Post in a series of ;Washington that Segretti had told him that Dwight L. Cha- pin, President Nixon's appoint- ments secretary, and Water. - gate bugging conspirator L. Howard Hunt Jr. were his con- tacts in spying and sabotage operation. .Young, Segretti and Chapin'. ,were all friends in the early 1960s when they attended the University of Southern Cali- fornia together. The letter directs Young not to repeat any of his earlier statements or make any addi- tional'disclosures. "I deny any lawyer-client relationship," Young said yes- terday in a telephone inter- view from Los Angeles. "I re- ceived no legal fees and asked Segretti three times if he wanted to retain me and he said 'no' each time." Young said the letter, com- ing more than five months af- ter his first public disclosures about Segretti's activities, is the first indication, that Se- gretti might claim that their conversations were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.

The FBI summary said that Herbert W.

In a related development 'yesterday, Mary Lou Burg, care Hla" 8 Qehttao ng Convicted Watergate con- spirator James W. McCord Jr. has testified under oath that his hiring as security coordi- nator for the Committee for the Re-election of the Presi- dent was apparently cleared through White House counsel John W. Dean III. ? The White House said last night that Dean has "no recol- ?lect.ion of ... being involved In the hiring of McCord." Dean, who recommended ,that watergate conspirator G. `Gordon Liddy be hired by the' ire-election committee, is one of the high presidential aides .who McCord has said he was told had advance knowledge of the bugging of Democratic .headquarters. In a sworn deposition to at- torneys for ' the President's re-election committee, McCord said that he. was first con- tacted in the fall of 1971 about doing security work in the Nixon campaign, and that the contact was made by Alfred Wong, the special agent In charge of the White house Se- cret Service detail. Wong, according to Mc- Cord's testimony, told him that if he was interested In a job in the campaign -someone would call him later.

McCord's deposition to law- yers for the committee is I being taken as part of one of the civil suits,arising from the June 17 break-in at the, Watergate. At one point in the deposi- tion McCord refused to say if he had any tape recordings in his possession that might be relevant to the bugging con- spiracy, after' being advised by attorney Henry B. Roth- blatt not to answer the ques- tion until being granted im- munity from further prosecu- tion. McCord was granted such immunity on Thursday, and Is' expected ~o answer the ques-' tion when the deposition 'con- tinues next week. Another attorney for Mc- Cord, Bernard Fensterwald, said the only tapes that he knows are in McCord's posses- sion are recordings of lectures. for classes he gave in securityl work at Montgomery Junior College. At another point in the deposition, McCord said he took notes about activities "in' the security area" while at the' Nixon re-election committee! and has since turned some ofj them over to a grand jury in- vestigating the Watergate bug-~ ging. I McCord also said that for a? two-week period in April he went daily to the apartment of: former Attorney General] Mitchell to pick up the Mitch- ells' daughter and drive her to school because Mrs. Mitch. ell feared, she might be 'harmed. He said he would often meet, Mitchell or Mrs. Mitchell or' 'their maid, there, although, Mitchell has said under oath he only met McCord once ?-~ at the re-election committee -? . except to pass him in the hall at the committee. Mrs. Mitchell, McCord testi- fied, was so concerned about ' the family's security, including the possibility of being wire-' tapped or bugged, that he once X-rayed all the furpiture in the Mitchell's apartment, after she ,received a death threat over her unlisted telephone. Mc- Cord said he also had a tele- phone company security officer check out the Mitchell's tele phones. McCord himself said he has been the target of a telephoned bomb threat since agreeing to -disclose all he knows about the Watergate conspiracy and pos- sibly other related illegal ac- tivities.

Colson,, former spe- with the campaign of espion- cial counsel to President Nixon; age and disruption that was h as voluntarily taken a private lie-detector test in New York to buttress his sworn testimony that he had nothing to do with the Watergate raid last summer. Ciose friends of Mr. Colson 'in New York disclosed that Richard O. Arther, president of Scientific Lie Detection, Inc., who is an authority in his field, conducted the test and con- cluded on Wednesday that Mr. Colson had "truthfully" deniedl all foreknowledge of the plot. Mr. Arther and Mr. Colson's personal lawyer, who helped to prepare the examination re- 'fused to elaborate on the ques- tions asked and the results. Mr. Colson was unavailable. reportedly directed from thel White House against several Democratic Presidential candi- dates last year. Mr. Colson's resort to the' lie detector, believed to be the: first of its kid in the Water- gate case, appeared to signal a new eagerness among.,mem- bers of the President's inner circle to document their inno- cence. The 41-year-old Mr. Colson has consistently denied all in-' volvement in the break-in at the Democratic party head- quarters at the Watergate com- plex last June 17.

Mr. Colson branded the hearsay charge a "goddamned lie." Referring to a grand jury appearance last summer, a sworn deposition in a civil suit and an interview with the Fed- eral Bureau of ? Investigation, Mr. Colson repeated, "I've testi- fied under oath three times that I had no knowledge of it." But with his name' in the headlines again, and with the search for masterminds con- tinuing, he decided last week on a lie detector test as a way to clear his name. I ? He was also concerned, friends say, about the effect of rumors on his law practice. Partners in his New Law firm, Colson & Shapiro, which has hired 10 new lawyers in anttici- pation of the business that Mr. Colson could attract, also urged him to undergo the test. New York associates of Mr. Colson who have read the test results say that he was,asked to state whether he had any knowledge of the bugging of the Democratic National Com- mittee offices before June 17, 1972, when five invaders were captured, with their electronic recording equipment, in the Watergate office building. He was also asked to say whether he had been telling the truth earlier when he denied all in'- .volvement. On these and three other closely related questions; Mr. Arther, the examiner, is reliably understood to have concluded that Mr. Colson was "truthful in all respects." Gene Sandacz, a vice presi- dent of Mr. Arther's company, said today that David I. Shapiro, 'Mr. Colson's law partner and R 0 -M -_nlr.on AT de By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward Washington Post Staff Writers White House chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman, the man who controls the flow of both paper and people to the President, is losing his cherished anonymity as his' name becomes entangled in the Watergate affair. The Senate has estab- lished a special select com- mittee to investigate the- Watergate bugging a n d other related acts of politi- cal espionage and sabotage and a federal grand jury has renewed its inquiry. . Sources familiar with both investigations say that final understanding of the widespread undercover ac- tivities of the 1972 Nixon campaign is largely de- pendent on determining Haldeman's role in those events. These are the known ele- ments about the President's No. 1 aide and the Water- gate, as pieced together from sources in the FBI, Justice Department, White House, Senate, the Commit. tee for the Re-election of the President and the Rep- ublican Party:, ? To date, Investigators have developed?no hard evi- dence involving Haldeman In the electronic eavesdrop- ping at the Watergate or other illegal activities. ? Haldeman told an off- the-record meeting with some Republican congress- men last month that he personally o r d e r e d the "surveillance" of Demo- cratic presidential candi- dates, including the taping of their speeches and public statements and gave the impresison that the opera- tion somehow "got out of hand." (One congressman at the meeting said he took this to mean that Haldeman acknowledged setting up the operation from which the Watergate bugging stemmed.) ' ? Haldeman effectively ran the President's reelec- tion committee, a creation of the White House, and put his own trusted aides in most of the key positions of responsibility there. ? Most of the men alleged to have played central roles in a broad campaign of po. litical espionage and sabo- tage - among them former presidential appointments secretary Dwight L. Chapin, deputy Nixon campaign di- rector .Jeb Stuart Magruder, and former presidential assi-. tant Gordon Strachan - had previously worked di, his legal adviser in this case, had helped to frame the ques- tions in a - manner that also briefed Mr. Colson in advance on the wording of the questions. Independent experts in the use of the polygraph, or lie de- tector, said today that the prep- aration of subjects on the con- tent of their examination was, standard procedure-that-helped, to heighten the sensitivity of the test. Mr. Colson, a tough-talking, ex-marine, has in the past seemed to take pride in his reputation as President Nixon's "hatchet man." He once said that he would do "anything Richard Nixon asked-me to do -period." Takes Credit For `Leak' He took credit for leaking the. report, hinting - at conflict of interest, that helped to defeat Senator Joseph D. Tydings, a Maryland Democrat, in 1970. And he was proud last year to, have nursed the White House alliance with the International fund were his own lieuten- ants. The White House has denied that Haldeman con- trolled disbursements from the fund. ? During a campaign strategy meeting in late 1971, Haldeman told then- Attorney General John N. Mitchell that certain secu- rity operations then under White House and Justice Department jurisdiction should be transferred to the Committee for the Reelec- tion of the President. One result of that decision was the transfer of Watergate conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt Jr. from the White House staff where they investi- gated news leaks, to the Committee for the Re-elec- tion of the President. ? Three of the four men named by convicted Water- gate conspirator James. W. 1'IcCord Jr. as allegedly hav- ing advance knowledge of the bugging are present or former Haldeman deputies.

The teamsters union endorsed the Republican President last year and recently hired Mr. Colson's law firm as its Wash- ington counsel. In a famous memo to his staff in the White House, Mr. Colson wrote last August, "I would walk over my grand- mother if necessary" to re-elect the President. However, he has vehemently and repeatedly de- nied that the.watergato hreak- in was his project.

Since the arrest of five men inside Democratic headquarters on June 17, Haldeman-with President Nixon, former Attorney General Mitchell and White, House Counsel Dean-have been almost the sole archi- tects of the White House re-' sponse and carefully worded denials of the allegations loosely gathered under the term "Watergate," According to sources in the Nixon administration and federal law enforce- ment agencies, the Water- gate bugging stemmed from a broad campaign of politi- cal espionage and sabotage conceived in the White House in 1971, before Presi- dent Nixon emerged as the clear. favorite to be re- elected. Several sources, including past and present members of the White 'House staff,, have said that the clandes- tine activities represented a basic strategy to attempt to determine the person the Democrats would nominate as their presidential candi- date.

Last fall, one highly placed source in the' Justice Department described the overall, well-financed pro- gram of espionage and sabc- tage as "a Haldeman opera- tion."

Stans, the Nixon campaign finance' chairman. In its report, The Post had made an incorrect attrib- ution to grand jury testi- mony by one of his former White House assistants,' Nixon committee treasurer Hugh W. Sloan Jr. This ap- parently was the allusion made by Haldeman to the report being "messed . . up" by The Post. Highly placed sources in. both the Justice Department and the Committee for the Re-election of the President have subsequently recon-, firmed the substance of the- account, and in the words of one person with first-hand knowledge.. of the operation of the fund, identified Haldeman as "the guiding hand" behind the expendi-. tures from the fund, From that fund, Magru der, who was Haldeman's hand-picked choice to serve as interim manager of the Nixon re-election campaign until it was taken over by John Mitchell, authorized the payment of more than $200,000 to convicted Water- gate conspirator Liddy. In addition, Liddy re- ceived an additional $35,000 from the fund from another, former member of Halde- man's White I-louse staff, Herbert L.

Haldeman's principal' White House political aide during the 1972 campaign, Gordon Strachah, has also left the presidential staff in the wake of news reports linking him to the hiring of Segretti, a University of Southern California class- inate of Chapin. According to federal in- vestigative sources, Stra- chan put Watergate conspir- ator Liddy in touch with Segretti to merge two politi- .cal spying and sabotage op-, erations that until then were nominally separate one run by Hunt and Liddy at the Nixon re-election committee, and the other in- volving Segretti and the White House.

"Liddy had planned for the meeting very carefully and had drafted out in longhand budget figures ' for various items of expense, and had dis- cussed them and certain de- tails of the overall operation with Jeb Magruder (who) re- portedly set up the meeting with Mitchell." McCord's carefully worded memo says he believed Liddy was planning to send or hand carry the plans "to someone in the White House. I do not know to whom he took it." As Liddy recounted It to McCord, the crucial Justice Department meeting was "set up for one particular day, but was cancelled, and reset for a day or so later" McCord's statement says Liddy spent about $7,000 to have four-by-four-foot charts drawn up for the meeting.

According to court papers filed by Hunt, two note- books-said by his attorneys, to contain names and ad- -dresses that could have been. used as investigative tools in: the Watergate probe-were, not among the items re- ceived by the FBI. . During the period while: Dean was holding the mate- rial from Hunt's safe,- he: told an FBI agent that he, did not know whether Hunt, had a White House office, prompting Acting FBI Di- rector L. Patrick Gray to tell. the Senate ? Judiciary Com-, mittee that Dean "proba?bly" lied 'to the bureau. In the wake of June 17 break-in at the Watergate, President Nixon has said he. appointed Dean to conduct a, .White House investigation. to determine if members. of, .the presidential staff were. 'involved in the bugging op-, eration. That investigation, which absolved all then-current White House personnel, was "a direct pipeline i to Halde- man," according to one of the few Justice Department officials familiar with its de. tails. Watergate conspirator Mc- Cord, during his appearance before the Senate 'select` committee, was asked if he' ' knew whether Haldeman had anything to do with the gathered In Mitchell's office in the afternoon, as McCord recalled it and "from what Liddy told me it lasted an hour or more." Liddy, according to McCord, said that the discussions at the Justice Department "covered the pros and corts of various ;bugging type operations. No I decisions were made at the 'meeting . but the impres- sion Liddy had seem(ed) to be 'that the operation would be approved." Within a few days, "Dean told Liddy that a way would have to be worked out to un- dertake the operation without directly Involving the Attor- ney General so that he would have deniability about it at a future date. "Dean told Liddy at this time that the funding for the operation would subsequently, come to him through other; than regular Committee for the Re-Election (of the President) funding mecha- nisms so that there would be Watergate bugging, ` and' replied: "I have no knowl- edge of it, no knowledge of it if he did." Nonetheless, several news-' papers mistakenly reported that McCord had implicated Haldeman.- Meanwhile, Sen. Lowell' Pr Weicker (R-Conn.), a fresh: man senator and member of the Watergate select, com-? mittee, cited highly placed, Republican Party sources ? and charged last week that, Haldeman had condoned the. Nixon campaign's overall es-rt pionage and sabotage opera: tions. The result, said Weicker,, was "an almost competitive' attitude as to who could do the dirtiest deed" at the Committee for the Re-oleo-; tion of the ,President. Dc' manding Haldeman's resig-, nation, Weicker said the- White House chief of staff "clearly has to accept re- sponsibility" for what occur- red during the campaign. But last Wednesday, Sen: Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), chair-` man of- the Senate commit- tee on Watergate, issued a statement about Haldeman that Senate sources said was' designed to keep his com-' mittee clear of any charges of innuendo in its investiga Lion. Said Ervin: "In the interest of fair.: ness and Justice, the com mittee wishes to state pubes licly that as of this time it has received no evidence of any nature linking Mr. Haldeman with any illegal' activities in connection with the presidential campaign of 1972." . lan'm", r .no record of it ..."

Of the two, Liddy was most inclined to brag and drop names. + The funds for the Water. gate break-in and - bugging were distributed by Hunt, who always dealt in cash. After his cohorts were caught at gunpoint inside Democratic Party headquarters, he contin. ued to dole out cash to pay the legal and living expenses of the defendants. But there- atergate 'after, Hunt's superiors never contacted him directly but de- livered money through his wife, Dorothy, who was killed in a Chicago airliner -crash with $10,000 in her purse.

James McCord, the mem- ber of the Watergate conspir- acy who is now talking, worked with the White House staff as a CIA agent. One source told us McCord's CIA activities brought him into di- rect contact in the 1950s with Richard Nixon, then the Vice President. McCord has ac- knowledged that he was hired as President Nixon's security, chief for the 1972 campaign through his old White House contacts. Investigators de- scribe McCord as solid, hon- est, intensely patriotic, with an almost fanatic hatred of communism. 0 Despite an outward ap- pearance of amity, Hunt and Liddy were jealous of each other, each vying with the other to bring off more spec.: tacular coups.

And Justice De- partment sources are con- vinced that a man who would hold his hand over a candle flame will sit it out as long as necessary in a jail cell. White House aides, mean- while, are spreading the story that Liddy is mentally unbal- anced and promoted the whole Watergate adventure himself. This kind of talk could back- fire and bring Liddy out of his jail cell with an angry rebut- tal. We have carefully investi- gated the possibility, however, that Liddy may have recruited the Mission Impossible team and ordered the Watergate break-in strictly on his own to satisfy Ibis romantic bent. We established that he had huge pictures of himself be- side a police car, gun and flashlight at the ready; that he threatened to kill people who crossed him; that he terrified the youngsters in his neigh- borhood once by leaping out at them "like Batman" from a garage roof. My associate Jack Cloherty talked to parents and children, in Liddy's neighborhood. They said he sent his own children to bed before dark and be- came agitated when the neigh. borhood kids, made noise around his house. He berated them, chased them and, on one occasion, leaped upon them from a hid- ing place on the garage roof. Another time, he lay in wait, for some loudly talking teen- agers, jumped them and slap- ped one of them around. After this incident, a delega- tion of parents called on him to complain about his abuse of the neighborhood children. They noted that his guns were prominently displayed on the dining room table throughout] their visit. Others who know Liddy de- scribe him as mentally sharp, if slightly eccentric.

' Liddy's father, Sylvester, Liddy, a respected New York i attorney, also described the i rumors about his son's mental! instability as "nauseating" and denounced the portrayal of t the younger Liddy "as flaky, self-promoting adventurer." We have also established that money was delivered by higher-ups to pay the legal, and living expenses of the break-in crew after they were caught. at gunpoint in Demo. cratic Party headquarters. This suggests that the highet+ ups, whoever they are, recog? nixed their responsibility fot the Watergate crimes.

R cC'ord Tells of aternate ~'ayment~ By Jack Anderson In secret testimony before the grand jury, Watergate defendant James McCord has confided that his co-conspira- tor, Howard Hunt, last July feared the President's cam- paign chiefs were abandoning 1them and wrote a three-page 'letter demanding "to contact someone in the White House." Thereafter, money allegedly was delivered to Hunt's attor- ney, William O. Dittman, for distribution to the defendants. Mrs. Hunt, acting as the cour- ier, arranged to meet McCord at various places and slip him cash payments. McCord testi- fied that he received around $45,000 after the Watergate break-in for "salary" and legal expenses. The grand jury Is trying to track down who authorized the payments and whether the money was intended to buy the defendants' silence. Bri'h- cry to obstruct justice, of course, is a serious federal vio- lation. As McCord related it to the grand jury, he received a phone call around July 20 from Hunt. "He asked me," said McCord, "to go to a pay phone away from the house. !'Afraid We Might Talk' "He felt the Committee to Re-elect the President (was) trying to do him in and to do us in for good and to put us away and abandon us.

Testified McCord: "(Hunt) said, 'we have legal fee money for you.' And I said, 'What goes along with it?' He put it this way, 'Everybody's naturally inter- ested in knowing whether you're going to keep quiet."' McCord felt this was merely a maneuver to keep him quiet until the election, 'so he put off Hunt until Nov. 7. Then'he decided "to go ahead and take the legal fee money." But he refused to be bound if, the le- gal fees were offered "as a weapon to keep us from. say- ing anything." The question came up again at a meeting with Mrs. Hunt on Nov. 30. As McCord inter- preted the conversation, "essentially there wasn't going to be any more money unless you fellows agree to plead guilty and take executive clemency at a later time and keep your mouth shut." He quoted her as saying, Cher' Hunt nor McCord would,, go along with that cover story. Then there was talk about,, blaming the whole affair" on Gordon Liddy, the Watergate" ringleader.

McCord said he, too, felt "they were more inter- ested in keeping us in jail than they were in getting us out, because they were afraid we might talk." McCord later learned from Mrs. Hunt that her husband had written a three-page letter which, was read to the I cam- paign committee's . attorney, Kenneth W. Parkinson. Re- counted McCord: ."She said that 'when Bittman. read the letter to Parkinson that Hunt wanted to contact someone in the White House, Parkinson said, 'Give us a week.' And Hunt came back and said, 'No you get two days.' "So they said, 'Okay. Some- thing will be worked out in a couple of days.' And that something, It appeared to me, had to do with a contact and it also had something to do with the funding for the defendants Not long afterward, Mrs. 'Hunt, .using the code name "Chris," called to arrange the first transfer of funds. "I went over to her car and she gave me an envelope and she said, 'This is the payment for your salary 'for five months, begin- ning in July through whatever it is'-I think It was Novem- ber... "I asked her if she wanted a receipt and she said, no, it was not necessary, that she would be making an accounting to Mr. Bittman for it." McCord also talked to her about legal fees. "They want to, know" she reported back to him later, "if you're. going to keep quiet." "They want to know if more, than one year is okay with yon ... staying in jail more than' one year, and then executiv4- clemency." McCord turned. down the deal saying he was going to plead not guilty and, fight the case. "And she re; peated this to me three more, times," he recalled, "and''1.t was in the context of 'Well, Plitt not sure they're going to. give you any more money' .. .

As part 'of the mission, Hunt, a former Central Intelli? gence Agency sleuth, went to the CIA's placement bureau, which willingly provided him with the name of a locksmith skilled in "lockpicking" and opening "a locked room." The locksmith, Thomas Amato, said he'd rather sailboat with his family than spy for the GOP, Hunt testified. The articulate Hunt, who once paid a secret visit to ITT memo-writer Dita Beard in an ill-fitting red wig, said he dis- guised his name during the Miami mission out of habit. As a CIA man he had often trav- eled under false papers In case he was hijacked to Cuba, he said. It was natural, then, that when he went to Miami with Liddy, the same air of mystery that surrounded Hunt's CIA work and his numerous pub- lished thrillers prevailed.

Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who then seemed' to have "a lead" ,among the candidates. Hunt testified that "when Kennedy . would in fact be a candi- tate" was the big question for Liddy, the flamboyant counsel for the Committee for the Re. election'of the President. But Hunt, traveling as "Ed: Warren" and Liddy, as "George Leonard,' had far more in mind than just espio- nage on Kennedy's place in the presidential race. They checked into Miami Beach's plush Playboy Plaza and met with Hunt's old "comrade inj arms," ex-CIA agent Jack Bau-1 man. -What Liddy, who was running the Miami venture, wanted from Bauman was no less than total "Intelligence on everything the Den'ocratsi Approved For Release 2001/08/97 were doing "in terms of politi- cal action," Hunt swore.

The Liddy blueprint also called for spying on those can- didates close to "radical peo- ple," reports on where all can- didates were at all times and how many hotel rooms each candidate's delegations were occupying.

A few days later, Bau- man sat down again with Hunt at the Hay Adams hotel just across Lafayette Park 'from the White House. As Hunt gloomily described it to the grand jury, Bauman said fie "was not going to cooperate" with the master spying scheme. . At about the same time, the conspirators got the bad news on Amato's preference for sailing. 'When the prosecutor asked Hunt why they needed a lockpicker, Hunt said .

After the election; the cash was delivered surreptitiously to a campaign aide, with Haldeman's approval, In an ap- parent violation of the new campaign disclosure law. This is the sworn testimony of Haldeman's loyal former as- sistant, Gordon Strachan, who picked up the money the day before the disclosure law went into effect. He received it from Hugh Sloan, the cam- paign treasurer, but returned it to Fred LaRue, a campaign aide, at his Watergate apart- ment.- It took Strachan 45 minutes, he testified, to. count all the cash. Yet no receipt was asked, and none was given. He quoted LaRue as saying merely: "I'll take care of this." The money was supposed to be used, explained Strachan, for polling. He acknowledged that the President's campaign committee was already con- ducting "a very, very exten- sive polling operation." Yet $350,000 was taken away from the committee and stashed in the White House, he said, "in WASHINGTON POST 20 April 1973 ' "Who told you to go to Mr. LaRue and give him the money?" asked Seymour Glan- zer, an'assistant U.S. attorney.

For example, at one 'point Anderson quotes Mc- Cord as telling the grand jury of a phone call he re- ceived last July 20 from to give it back to you since I got it from you,' but you call Mr. LaRue." First Strachan said it was because Sloan had left, the committee. When asked why he, didn't return It to his suc- cessor, he said: "I honestly don't know." Then Glanzer resumed the questioning. "Have you talked to Mr. Haldeman in the last couple of weeks?" he asked. "Yes I have," replied Stra- chan. "About your appearance be. fore the grand jury?" "Yes I have." "What did you say to him and what did he say to you,'; pressed the prosecutor. - "He told me," replied Stra- chan, "to tell the absolute' truth and to not worry about any political consequences., And those are my orders ...". "Is there any 'reason," de- manded Glanzer, "why Mr,. Haldeman would have to urge, you to tell the truth?"

All three have- protested their Innocence, and the case against them is still largely circumstantial. But witnesses .before the grand jury have given secret testimony, which darkens the cloud over' the trio. The apse against them rests heavily upon Watergate wire- tapiier James McCord's charge that the burglary-bugging op- eration was actually planned 'in Mitchell's Justice Depart- ment. office by Mitchell, Ma- gruder and Dean, with Water- 'gato ringleader G; Gordon Liddy givipg the briefing, On April 2, we quoted from ?McCord's confidential initialed memo that "John Dean, 'Job Magruder, Gordon Liddy and John Mitchell in Feb. 1072 met In Mitchell's office at the Department of Justice : and held the first formal discus- olon of hugging and related op'orationy," - The memo states that Liddy prepared huge . four-feet-by- four-feet charts for the meet- Ing. "The charts were brought In late one afternoon and left in (Liddy's) office on the 4th floor wrapped in brown pa- per," McCord related. Liddy's former secretary, Silvia Panarites, - has con- firmed to the grand jury that a meeting was scheduled. "It was a meeting at the Justice' Department,"' she testified, "among Mr. Liddy, Mr. Magru. der and Mr. Mitchell." Mysterious Package "Now, Miss Panarites," asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Campbell, "did, there come a time when you ob- served a brown package in Mr; Liddy's office?" "Yes, sir," she replied. She described the package as about fours feet in dimension, an inch thick, wrapped In brow>i paper. "Mr. Liddy him- self carried the package into the office ... "? she testified. "He did say that I was not to look in the package; that it was better for me not to know of its contents ... " The mysterious package was left in Liddy's office over- night, she said, so Liddy asked her to hide it in case "somebody should happen to walk in,.it would not be seen .. So I moved the bookcase and put the package behind the bookcase." Another prosecutor, Sey mour Glanzer, asked whether Liddy's removal of the pack. age the next, day was "related in your mind to this appoint.' ment he had at Justice?"

"Gemstone" Papers The most damaging grand jury testimony disputes Ma- gruder's sworn statement that he knew nothing of the Water- gate bugging. Another Liddy secretary, Sally Harmon, testi- fied that she had typed up re- ports on the conversations of Democratic Party officials. She' used secret stationery with the. code word, "Gem- stone," printed on top, she said, She reported that the cam- paign committee's own printer had delivered the "Gemstone" stationery to Liddy's .'office and had cautioned her: "Mr. Liddy said no one is to' see this." After the arrest of the bur- glary-bugging squad at the Watergate, Magruder in . a phone call from California in- structed his assistant, Robert Reisner, to remove sensitive files from his office.

Reisner said he turned .the "Gemstone" folder over ?'to campaign official Robert Odle who later testified he returned it to Magruder without exam- ining it.

While Schlesinger is report- edly embarking on a house cleaning to'cut about a 1,000 persons from the CIA payroll' of about 15,000, he' has given his stamp of approval - at least for the time being - to the military intelligence oper ation, Hall said. "I have told the DCI (Schlesinger) what we are-. doing, what our objectives. are, and how, we are going', about researching them in a broad sense -and he's en-; dorsed them," Hall said. rHE DIA, the key Pentagon intelligence office, underwent a house cleaning of its own beginning in 1970, when Lt. Gc:n. Donald V. Bennett be- came its director. The entire defense intelligence communi. ty has received a further sh king up under Hall. Over the years, there has been a tendency to downgrade the military estimate of the thrc at from other countries -- primarily the Stwiet Union -- and for the civilian analysis of the CIA to be predominant,. Hall said. "On the civilian side - up the river - they were more. inclined to regard the Soviet Union as a more peaceful ent-, THE WASHINGTON POSr Saturday, Apr it 7,1973 Bin gtoua Murry-Go-Roused ity than it actually is. Their tendency is to regard what they (the Soviets) do as a reaction to us," Hall said. .The military picture tends to make the Soviets look like the fierce guys, and that we've got to catch up, he said. "In analysis of the Soviet Union, one was too far on one side, the other too far on the 'other side. I don't want to overstate this, because it was not that bad a situation. But it' would be better if they both moved toward the middle," Hall said.

"It it important to get the' ranges and the circumstances laid out," he said. Unfortunately, he added, many of those who receive the intelligence information would rather have a specific figure than a range" of choices.. l ' FL Burs FBI Water Jack Andersoit The Central Intelligence Agency has ordered Its agents not to talk to the Federal Bu- reau of Investigation about the explosive Watergate case Yet curiously, the CIA has cooperated fully with Sen.

It could mean denying the public the information necessary to under- stand how cost estimates In 47 weap- ons systems rose by over $2 billion between March 31 and June 30 last year. Thus, the Administration's official secrets act would create staggering penalties for disclosure of information even when the information is totally misclassificd or 'classified only to prevent public knowledge of waste, error, dishonesty or corruption. We already have the criminal sanc- itions Nye need against disclosure of true defense secrets.

New penalities will not further deter espionage and spying. They will ,only harm those who want the public to know what the Goverrunent is doing. . . Nothing could be better designed to restrict the news you get to the pasteurized jargon of official press- releases than a law which would punish a newsman for receiving sen- sitive information unless he returned the material promptly to an authorized. official. Nothing could damage'the press more than a provision which would make a newsman an accomplice in. crime unless he revealed. the source of information disclosed to him. - The Administration proposal carries an' even greater danger in the power it would give to the officials who now determine what shall be secret and what shall be disclosed. Not only would they be able to' continue to make those decisions without regard to any real injury disclosure might cause, they would be. empowered to prosecute anyone , who defied their judgment. Their imposition of secrecry could not be reviewed in the courts. And a violation of their decision would be a crime involving not only Govern= ment employees but journalists as well. The, Justice Department proposal goes far beyond any laws we have had, even the emergency requirements of World Wars I and 11. No law now gives the Government such power to prosecute newsmen not only for re- vealing what they determine the public should know but just for possessing information the Government says they. should not have. Under this proposal, a reporter who catches the Government in a lie, who uncovers fraud, who unearths ex- amples of monumental waste could go to jail-even if he could show,-be. yond any question, that the Govern- ment had not right to keep the in- formation secret and that its release could not possibly harm national do 'fcnse. This law then would force journalists to rely on self-serving press releases manufactured by timid bureaucrats- or risk going to jail for uncovering the truth. It would force Government employes to spy on each other. in a manner fa- miliar in Communist or fascist states but abhorrent to our concept- of an. .open democracy, We have had enough of that abuse of secrecy in the attempts to hide the facts about our conduct in Vi'tnam from the American people.

Une 'a bbagton Merry-Go-Hound THE' WASHTNCTON POST Frfdoy, 4prt 6,197s By Jack Anderson, Minutes of a meeting be- tween Secretary of State Bill Rogers and industrial tycoons doing business in Chile quote the Secretary as repeatedly re-, assuring them "that the Nixon', administration was a business administration and Its mission was to protect business." Nevertheless. he refused to retaliate against Chile for ex- propriating American-owned businesses. It is clear front the minutes that he didn't want to oush President Salvador Al- lende into Soviet arms. V----fused Act ai Chile Rogers indicated, according to the minutes, "that he had talked with the Russian For.. eign Minister as to whether or not Moscow was going to fi- nance Chile as It had Cuba. The Russian denied any such Intention. Rogers went on to show grave concern of Rus- sian domination of Latin. America and its impact." The Oct. 22, 1971, meeting. was attended by representa ; tives of International Tele- phone and Telegraph, Ana- conda Copper, Ford Motor, Bank of America, First Na- tional City and Ralston Pu- rina. The minutes were kept by ITT. Most of the angry business- men wanted the U.S. govern. ment to bail them out by tak. lag action against Chile. Only the Ralston Purina representa- tive, whom the ITT minutes describe as a "dove," recom- mended "Ave not cut off ship- ments to Chile but should use private sources to impress Al- lende and his governnient to stay In the Western bloc." The most Rogers would do was consider an "informal em- bargo" and recommend "periodic meetings" on the problem. "The Secretary raised the question," the min- utes state, "of whether there should be an Informal em-, bargo on spare parts and ma- terials being shipped to Chile.; The consensus of the group' was quite mixed. Rogers rec- ommended that there be peri- odic meetings of the group to attempt to solidify a position." The ITT executives went away disgruntled over Rogers' attitude. Concludes the min-1 utes: "In summary, the en-1 tire meeting indicates that the Secretary is pretty much go-' lag along with the . soft. line, low-profile policy -for Latin America."

Further, he testified, he signed any number of state- ments dealing with the security of "top secret" documents. At One point, David R. Nissen, the chief prosecutor, asked him if he had read portions of the Espionage Act referring to classified documents. Dr. Ells- berg answered that "to the best of my knowledge there is noth- ing in the Espionage Act about classified documents, so I couldn't have read them." . He was asked if anyone had given him permission to remove the documents in 1969 from the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, where he was em- ployed, to a Los Angeles ad- vertising office, where he Xer- axcd them at night. , "No," he answered. "No one had given you per- mission to copy them?". ; Mr. Nissen asked. "That is correct," Dr. Ell;;- berg answered. The pledge not to copy tie documents had been disclosed bafn.?e, but this was the first time that it had been disclosed to the jury. Dr. Ellsberg said that the Xeroxing was done in about eight sessions, strating on Sept. 30, 1969, and going into No- vember. On some of those occasions, he said, he worked alone; on others he was helped by An- thony J. Russo Jr., his co-de- fendant. Lynda Sinay was then the owner of the small adver- tising agency, and she helped, he said. So, too, did his son, Robert, then nearly 14 years old, who helped out twice. Once his daughter, Mary, then nearly 11, was at the agency. He was asked whether Miss Sinay or Mr. Russo or his scn Robert had been given official access to the documents, and he answered, No. Nor, he said, had Vu Van Thai, a former South Vietnamese. Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Thai and Miss Sinay are co-conspire- tors but not co-defendants. Dr. Ellsberg told the jury that after each Xerox session he ei- ther returned the documents that evening to Rand or on the next working day. When he copied the papers on a Friday night, he sometimes kept them in his Malibu hone until the following Monday, ter said.

HERSH Spectd to The New York Times WASHINGTON,' April 7- Samuel A. Adams, the Central Intelligence Agency analyst who testified about military de- ceit at the Pentagon papers 'trial, said in an interview to- day that he has apparently been discharged. The agency denied it. Mr. Adams has been persis- tently seeking a formal inquiry into the military's alleged falsi- fication of estimates of Viet- strength of Vietcong and Cam- bodian communists. He was re- cently transferred to another office, in part because of his protests, and thus is no longer directly involved in Southeast Asia intelligence matters. In his appearance at the trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and An- thony J. Russo Jr., Mr. Adams declared that there had been political pressures in the mili- tary to display the enemy as weaker than he actually was." He further charged that he had tong strength in late 1967.

He has yet to- receive any such notification, Mr. Adams said, despite repeated requests to his superiors over the last two weeks. As of the close of work Friday he had heard nothing; he added. The intelligence agency is no win the midst of a 10 per cent staff cutback that was re- cently authorized by its new di- rector, James R. Schlesinger. Those employes with poor per- formancer rating are to be weeded out first, according to some officials. Mr. Adams, 39 years old, who is a direct descendant of the Adams family of colonial times, had served since the mid-nine- A spokesman for the agency said that Mr. Adams was "still on the deck here" and added, "Of course, he has not been ficials in an attempt to kee'_, him from testifying. The thrust of his testimony was that at least some of the highly classified documents in the Pentagon papers, initially published In June, 1971, by The New York Times, were based on inaccurate and perhaps de- liberately misleading informa- tion, thus negating their im- portance to enemy Intelligence officers. In his testimony, the c.LA. official also disclosed that he was involved in 1971 in a simi- lar dispute over the strength of the Cambodian Communist forces. As a result of his re- search, Mr. Adams said at the trial, the estimated number' of Communist troops in Cambodia was officially raised to about 50,000 from, about 10,000.

"What I think happened," Mr. Adams said, "is that some people down at the lower level looked upon the recent staff cutback as an opportunity to finally get rid of me. They probably saw my Ellsberg' tes- timony as heightening the opportunity." Someone at higher levels ap- parently disagreed, Mr. Adams said, and the situation has yet to be resolved. - To resolve it, Mr. Adams be- gan a campaign' to get some official notification of his standing. Last week he wrote the deputy director of intelli- - gence, one of the top officials in the agency, a memorandum urging that he be formally told of his status within 24 hours. "If I have not heard from you by then," the memorandum said, "I will respectfully assume that the decision to declare me in excess is `final, and that I need wait no longer." When the deadline passed, he telephoned a reporter and ar- ranged for an Interview. They! had spoken two weeks earlier,' shortly after he testified In Los Angeles. Mr. Adams said then he was sure that any staff cut- backs in the agency would not affect him. "'They just wouldn't be so dumb as to do that to me now," he declared then. Mr. Adam's friends in the agency have repeatedly pro- fessed admiration for his integ- rity and his willingness to con- tradict official policy to ex- press his point of view. They also note, however, that Mr. In the interview, Mr. Adams professed admiration for the intelligence agency and the work it performs, although he acknowledged that he was per- sonally reprimanded or threat- ened with dismissal at least 12 times in his.10-year career. teen-sixties as one of the agen-I But now, he said, he wantsjAdams has not received a pro- Gies leading experts on the to end his career.

The Government contends that because Dr. Ellsberg was given access to the Pentagon papers for his job at Rand- which had a contract with the Government-the violation - of the Rand security manual was, in fact, a violation of Govern- ment security regulations. The defense contends that Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo at most, violated the Rand Corporation's regulations, which would have. called for dismissal but littler else. '! At the end of today's session,: the prosecutor said that he be-' lieved that he could completer his cross-examination in aboutl an hour tomerrow, and the de- fense said that it could com- glete its redirect of Dr. Ellsberg by the end of the day. The Government's rebuttal case would then start on Thurs- day morning. During the morning session, Dr. Ellsberg insisted that he had not decided to copy the Pentagon papers until the morning of Sept. 30, 1969, when .he called his co- defendant, Anthony J. Russo Jr., and asked him if he could find a Xerox machine on which to do the copying. That night Inventory of Papers It is the contention of the defense that one set - of the Pentagon papers was purposely kept out of the Rand "top secret" security system be- cause those papers were in fact the private papers of Defensg Departments officials, -and that Dr. Ellsberg and Harry Rowen. then Rand's president, were the only ones who had access to them.) In April, -1969, Dr. Ellsberg said he was notified, that the Rand security system was hav- ing an inventory of all its of- ficially logged "top secret" papers. He asked Mr. - Rowen what to do with the Pentagon papers that he had in his own "top secret" safe, he said, and Mr. Rowen told him to put them in the President's safe until the inventory was over. Two of Mr. Rowen's secre- taries were aware that he was transferring them to Mr. Row- en's safe, he said. Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140001-1 they started the Xeroxing. He also testified that when he picked up courier passes in March and August of that year to transport, first 10 volumes of the papers and then eight volumes, to Rand's Santa Mon- ica office from Rand's Washing- ton office, he did so in good faith, agreeing not to copy the papers that he later did copy. His answers were designed to defeat the Government's con- spiracy charge against the de- fendants. ' Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo are accused of six counts of espionage, six of theft and one count of conspiracy. Under cross-examination, Dr. Ellsberg told how he scurried about the corridors of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica in April will some of the volumes in a supermarket shop- ping cart to keep them from being discovered by Rand's security officers.

"Individual officers - an. economic counselor or a political counselor - would .look for opportunities.

A former U.S. ambassador to Chile has privately esti- mated that the far-flung covert program in Frei's be- half cost about $20 million. In contrast, the figure that emerged in Senate hearings as the amount ITT was will- ing to spend in 1970 to de- feat Allende was $1 million.

The first program loan in Latin America, a $40 million general economic develop- ment grant, was approved to buoy the Chilean economy, as the election approached. "We did not want to have a condition of vast unem- ployment as Chile was going into the election," recalled the former AID official. In addition to U.S. govern. ment asistance, Christian Democratic Party money was being funneled into Chile In Frei's behalf by the Ger- .man and Italian Christian Democratic parties. A m o n g the important channels were 'the German.

What the CIA sees, threatening about the, women's movement is, ,anybody's guess. The spy" agency can't be expected. to confirm or deny Mrs. Friedan's allegation. Good. ,spies don't.tell. The first report about the CIA and the women's movement was in a New York Times magazine arti- cle by Mrs. Friedan the. first part of March. It'was titled "Up From the Kitch- en Floor."

Miss Atkinson has an- nounced she is going to sue for $500,000 on ac- count of libel and slander.: After the Friedan article came out, Miss Atkinson and representatives of va- rious feminist groups, in-' eluding the National Women's Political Caucus, the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, held a press conference. They scored the Friedan article, es;>e= cially the reference to the CIA being behind disrup- tive elements of the move-, ment. But that didn't stop Mrs.- Friedan. About 10 days la- ter, she showed up -at a wine and cheese meeting at the New York apart- ment of Muriel Fox, chair- man of the board of the National Organization for Women and an executive at a New York public rela- tions agency.

In the interval, the corporation perhaps thought, the world had been' made safe for precisely the sort of old- fashioned economic imperialism-eor? porations expecting, their government to help them make money-that had gone out of style in the decades of the cold war. The very premise of the Church sub-` committee's look at ITT-CIA was that there is no longer an overarching na- tional security reason not to look One cannot imagine, for instance, a Senate committee looking three years after' 1964, or even noWV, at what the CIA' may have been up to in Chile In 1964:' Nor could one imagine, in an earlier period, that the CIA would let its dl.' rector, plus it top hand for dirty tricks in Latin America, testify before a Sen- ate committee. I am familiar with the "revisionist" 'discredit the entire wom- en's movement. In an interview, Miss A t k i n s o n said," Betty, pushed the wrong button this time." And in a copy- righted article in Majority Report, a feminist newspa- per serving the women of New York, Miss Atkinson replies to Mrs. Friedan. The article is titled: Betty Friedan, the CIA and Me, and in it Miss Atkinson says: "Betty Friedan'sarticle, Up From the Kitchen Floor . . is so riddled with lies that it is impossi.; ble fora feminist to make any sense out of it . ." She said the Friedan ar- ticle boils down to this: "Betty Friedan is the lead- er of the women's move- ment. All those other dis- reputables-issues such as prostitution, men as the enemy, marriage, moth- erhood, class and class s t r u c tures, lesbianism, sex, rape-are ideas plant- ed by the CIA and promul-, gated by agents and dupes thereof." argument that American foreign pol- icy, not only before World War II, but, afterwards, was dominated essentially by considerations of commerce: win- ning raw materials, markets, invest- ment privileges, and the like. The ar- gument seems to be persuasive only to' people who are already socialists or Marxists. My own view is that "political" considerations of power, status and fear were the stuff of the cold war. Granted, the notion that the world may now again be safe or ripe for old-` fashioned economic imperialism Is it rather Inflated conclusion to draw from the relatively' slender findings of the Senate inquiry Into ITT. Nor can it possibly be what everybody had in mind when they hoped that super-' power relations would begin to mel-' low. It would seem to be, nonetheless,, one of the possibilities deserving fur- ther scrutiny as we all strain to see what lies on the far side of the cold war. ..

So, American officials are pleased and surprised by the Bulgarian cooperation. One reason may be Bulgaria's concern over local hashish smoking. Unlike morphine base, the Middle East hash- ish is ready for use. Some of it circulates among young ,people in Sofia, and It is' also available at universities In Yugoslavia. American officials say that Bulgarian enforcement authorities are also angry at Western news articles that have described Bulgaria as a' "smugglers' paradise."

Previ- ously, communication was so poor that some persons who were arrested for drug offenses here were thought by relatives in the West to be missing. The Bulgarian customs service is well-esteemed. It is headed by Lazar Bonev, a handsome, middle-aged man who is said to have excellent' political connections in the, Bulgarian government. American officials are con- vinced that Bonev's service' is doing the best it can against tremendous odds. , "The smugglers we arrest. In Germany tell us that if, you make it through Bul- garia, you're clean," said % one American source. . The fact that many do, make it through attests to. the baffling task of enforce-. ment officials, which sortie, consider virtually lmpossi bile. The volume of traffic in the heroin pipeline is' overwhelming and growing. In 1970, 658,937 motoists crossed the Bulgarian bor-+ der in 162,138 vehicles. In the summer, the number of vehicles averages 8,000 to 10',000 a day. Many are driven by vacationers going .to or coming from Black Sea resort areas, and strict eon- trols could hurt vital tourist revenues. Sources say' that Austria is a favorite place for switching contraband from cars with Arab or Turkish li- cense plates or drivers to ones with West i German drivers and plates. This avoids suspicion at the West German, border, where con- trols are said to be the , toughest in Europe. Arabs and Turks are almost auto- matically searched carefully, sources connected with drug traffic controls say. In 1972, 2,300 kilograms (5,060 pounds) of morphine base were confiscated in the Stuttgart area. In the West German state of Bavaria, 416 persons-including 216 -Americans - were arrested for selling or transporting drugs. Southern Germany is a prime market for all kinds of drugs because the'largest contingent of the 300,000 American troops stationed in Europe is there. Some Western officials es- timate that half the mor- phine base used in the her- oin sold in American cities uses the main truck route from Istanbul, to Munich. This means that the bulk of It passes through ? the Turkish-Bulgarian border point at Kapikule. Even in winter, traffic there is heavy and inspec. tions on both sides of the border are necessarily cur- sory. West-bound lanes are crowded with trucks car- rying cargo to Western Eu- rope and the east-bound ones with trucks piled high with' washing machines and refrigerators that belong to Turkish workers returning from a tour in West Ger- man's booming industry. Besides the truck traffic, there 'are vacationers, tour- ists and workers from Yugo- slavia, Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.

Everette Howard Hunt Jr. (October 9, 1918 – January 23, 2007) was an American intelligence officer and author. From 1949 to 1970, Hunt served as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), particularly in the United States involvement in regime change in Latin America including the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état and the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. Along with G. Gordon Liddy, Frank Sturgis, and others, Hunt was one of the Nixon administration "plumbers", a team of operatives charged with identifying government sources of national security information "leaks" to outside parties. Hunt and Liddy plotted the Watergate burglaries and other clandestine operations for the Nixon administration. In the ensuing Watergate scandal, Hunt was convicted of burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping, eventually serving 33 months in prison. After release, Hunt lived in Mexico and then Florida until his death.

Hunt was born in Hamburg, New York, United States, the son of Ethel Jean (Totterdale) and Everette Howard Hunt Sr., an attorney and Republican Party official. He graduated, along with Howard J. Osborn, from Hamburg High School in Hamburg, New York in 1936 and Brown University in 1940. During World War II, Hunt served in the U.S. Navy on the destroyer USS Mayo, the United States Army Air Corps, and finally, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, in China.

Hunt was a prolific author, having published 73 books during his lifetime. During and after the war, he wrote several novels under his own name, including East of Farewell (1942), Limit of Darkness (1944), Stranger in Town (1947), Maelstrom (1949)  Bimini Run (1949), and The Violent Ones (1950). He also wrote spy and hardboiled novels under an array of pseudonyms, including Robert Dietrich, Gordon Davis, David St. John, and P. S. Donoghue. Hunt won a Guggenheim Fellowship for his writing in 1946. Some have found parallels between his writings and his experiences during Watergate and espionage. He continued his writing career after he was released from prison, publishing nearly twenty spy thrillers between 1980 and 2000.

Prior to 1949, Hunt served as an Officer in the Information Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, a predecessor of the Mutual Security Agency.

Shortly following the end of World War II the OSS was disbanded.  The subsequent emergence of the Cold War and the lack of a central intelligence organization resulted in the CIA's formation in 1947. Warner Bros. had just bought rights to Hunt's novel Bimini Run when he joined the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) in October 1949. He was assigned as a covert action officer specializing in political action and influence in what later came to be called the CIA's Special Activities Division.

Hunt became the OPC Station Chief in Mexico City in 1950, and recruited and supervised William F. Buckley Jr., who worked under Hunt in his OPC Station in Mexico during the period 1951–1952. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends, and Buckley became godfather to Hunt's first three children.In Mexico, Hunt helped lay the framework for Operation PBFortune, later renamed Operation PBSuccess, the successful covert operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala. Hunt was assigned as Chief of Covert Action in Japan. He afterwards served as Chief of Station in Uruguay, (where he was noted by American diplomatic contemporary Samuel F. Hart for controversial working methods).  Hunt would later say "What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign, to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops, much as the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium and Poland”.Hunt was subsequently given the assignment of forging Cuban exile leaders in the United States into a suitably representative government-in-exile that would, after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, form a pro-American Puppet state intent on taking over Cuba. The failure of the invasion temporarily damaged his career.Hunt was undeniably bitter about what he perceived as President John F. Kennedy's lack of commitment in attacking and overthrowing the government of Cuba. In his semi-fictional autobiography, Give Us This Day, he wrote: "The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip on the island of José Martí, then moved shamefacedly into the shadows and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away."

In 1959 Hunt helped CIA Director Allen W. Dulles write The Craft of Intelligence. The following year Hunt established Brigade 2506, an Agency-sponsored group of Cuban exiles formed to attempt the military overthrow of the Cuban government headed by Fidel Castro. It carried out the abortive Bay of Pigs Invasion landings in Cuba on 17 April 1961. After that fiasco, Hunt was reassigned as Executive Assistant to Dulles.

After President John F. Kennedy fired Dulles in 1961 for the Bay of Pigs failure, Hunt served as the first Chief of Covert Action for the Domestic Operations Division (DODS) from 1962 to 1964.
Hunt told The New York Times in 1974 that he spent about four years working for DODS, beginning shortly after it was set up by the Kennedy administration in 1962, over the "strenuous opposition" of Richard Helms and Thomas H. Karamessines. He said that the division was assembled shortly after the Bay of Pigs operation, and that "many men connected with that failure were shunted into the new domestic unit." He said that some of his projects from 1962 to 1966, which dealt largely with the subsidizing and manipulation of news and publishing organizations in the US, "did seem to violate the intent of the agency's charter."In 1964, DCI John A. McCone directed Hunt to take a special assignment as a Non-Official Cover (NOC) officer in Madrid, Spain, tasked to create the American answer to Ian Fleming's British MI-6 James Bond novel series.  While assigned in Spain, Hunt was covered as a recently retired U.S. State Department Foreign Service Officer (FSO) who had moved his family to Spain in order to write the first installment of the 9-novel Peter Ward series, On Hazardous Duty (1965).
After a year and a half in Spain, Hunt returned to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region (while remaining based in the Washington metropolitan area) in July 1968. Hunt was lauded for his "sagacity, balance and imagination", and received the second-highest rating of Strong (signifying "performance ... characterized by exceptional proficiency") in a performance review from the Division's Chief of Operations in April 1969. However, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of Adequate in an amendment from the Division's Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt's "broad experience" but opined that "a series of personal and taxing problems" had "tended to dull his cutting edge." Hunt would later maintain that he "had been stigmatized by the Bay of Pigs", and had come to terms with the fact that he "would not get promoted too much higher."
In these final years of Hunt's CIA service, he began to cultivate new contacts in "society and the business world." While serving as vice president of the Brown University Club of Washington, he befriended and commenced a strong association with the organization's president, former congressional aide Charles Colson, who soon began working on Richard Nixon's presidential campaign. Hunt retired from the CIA at the pay grade of GS-15, Step 8 on April 30, 1970.
Upon retiring from the CIA, Hunt neglected to elect survivorship benefits for his wife. An April 1971 request to retroactively amend his election was rebuffed by the agency. In a May 5, 1972, letter to CIA General Counsel Lawrence Houston, Hunt raised the possibility of returning to active duty for a short period of time in exchange for activating the benefits upon his proposed second retirement. Houston advised Hunt in his May 16 response that this "would be in violation of the spirit of the CIA Retirement Act".Immediately following his retirement, he went to work for the Robert R. Mullen Company, which cooperated with the CIA; H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff to President Nixon, wrote in 1978 that the Mullen Company was in fact a CIA front company, a fact that was apparently unknown to Haldeman while he worked in the White House. Through CIA's Project QKENCHANT, Hunt obtained a Covert Security Approval to handle the firm's affairs during Mullen's absence from Washington.

In 1971, Hunt was hired as a consultant by Colson, by now director of Nixon's Office of Public Liaison, and joined the White House Special Investigations Unit, specializing in political sabotage.Hunt's first assignment for the White House was a covert operation to break into the Los Angeles office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding. In July 1971, Fielding had refused a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for psychiatric data on Ellsberg. Hunt and Liddy cased the building in late August. The burglary, on September 3, 1971, was not detected, but no Ellsberg files were found.Also in the summer of 1971, Colson authorized Hunt to travel to New England to seek potentially scandalous information on Senator Edward Kennedy, specifically pertaining to the Chappaquiddick incident and to Kennedy's possible extramarital affairs. Hunt sought and used CIA disguises and other equipment for the project. This mission eventually proved unsuccessful, with little if any useful information uncovered by Hunt.Hunt's White House duties included assassinations-related disinformation. In September 1971, Hunt forged and offered to a Life magazine reporter two top-secret U.S. State Department cables designed to prove that President Kennedy had personally and specifically ordered the assassination of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, during the 1963 South Vietnamese coup. Hunt told the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 that he had fabricated the cables to show a link between President Kennedy and the assassination of Diem, a Catholic, to estrange Catholic voters from the Democratic Party, after Colson suggested he "might be able to improve upon the record."In 1972, Hunt and Liddy were part of an assassination plot targeting journalist Jack Anderson, on orders from Colson. Nixon had disliked Anderson because during the 1960 presidential election Anderson had published an election-eve story concerning a secret loan from Howard Hughes to Nixon's brother, which Nixon believed was the reason he lost the election. Hunt and Liddy met with a CIA operative and discussed methods of assassinating Anderson, which included covering Anderson's car steering wheel with LSD to drug him and cause a fatal accident, poisoning his aspirin bottle, and staging a fatal robbery. The assassination plot never materialized because Hunt and Liddy were arrested for their involvement in the Watergate scandal later that year.

According to Seymour Hersh, writing in The New Yorker, Nixon White House tapes show that after presidential candidate George Wallace was shot on May 15, 1972, Nixon and Colson agreed to send Hunt to the Milwaukee home of the gunman, Arthur Bremer, to place McGovern presidential campaign material there. The intention was to link Bremer with the Democrats. Hersh writes that, in a taped conversation, "Nixon is energized and excited by what seems to be the ultimate political dirty trick: the FBI and the Milwaukee police will be convinced, and will tell the world, that the attempted assassination of Wallace had its roots in left-wing Democratic politics." Hunt did not make the trip, however, because the FBI had moved too quickly to seal Bremer's apartment and place it under police guard.Hunt organized the bugging of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate office building.  Hunt and fellow operative G. Gordon Liddy, along with the five burglars arrested at the Watergate, were indicted on federal charges three months later.
Hunt put pressure on the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect the President for cash payments to cover legal fees, family support, and expenses, for himself and his fellow burglars. Key Nixon figures, including Haldeman, Charles Colson, Herbert W. Kalmbach, John Mitchell, Fred LaRue, and John Dean eventually became entangled in the payoff schemes, and large amounts of money were passed to Hunt and his accomplices, to try to ensure their silence at the trial, by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors' questions, and afterwards. Tenacious media, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, eventually used investigative journalism to break open the payoff scheme, and published many articles that proved to be the beginning of the end for the cover-up. Prosecutors had to follow up once the media reported. Hunt also pressured Colson, Dean, and John Ehrlichman to ask Nixon for clemency in sentencing, and eventual presidential pardons for himself and his cronies; this eventually helped to implicate and snare those higher up.Hunt was sentenced to 30 months to 8 years in prison, and spent 33 months in prison at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood and the low-security Federal Prison Camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on a conspiracy charge, arriving at the latter institution on April 25, 1975. While at Allenwood, he suffered a mild stroke.

Hunt supported the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

 The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination of Kennedy. The men later became known as the "three tramps". According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw. Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of The Tonight Show, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination. Later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis. Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield. Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in Rolling Stone and Newsweek.The Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in the assassination of Kennedy. The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the "derelicts" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis "were not shown to have any qualifications in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman". Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, "a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men was Hunt or Sturgis. In 1979, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the "tramps" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman. According to the Committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps, but determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney. According to the arrest reports, the three men were "taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot", detained as "investigative prisoners", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.

In 1973, Viking Press published Tad Szulc's book about Hunt's career titled Compulsive Spy. Szulc, a former correspondent for The New York Times, claimed unnamed CIA sources told him that Hunt, working with Rolando Cubela Secades, had a role in coordinating the assassination of Castro for an aborted second invasion of Cuba. In one passage, he also stated that Hunt was the acting chief of the CIA station in Mexico City in 1963 while Lee Harvey Oswald was there.The Rockefeller Commission's June 1975 report stated that they investigated allegations that the CIA, including Hunt, may have had contact with Oswald or Jack Ruby. According to the Commission, one "witness testified that E. Howard Hunt was Acting Chief of a CIA Station in Mexico City in 1963, implying that he could have had contact with Oswald when Oswald visited Mexico City in September 1963." Their report stated that there was "no credible evidence" of CIA involvement in the assassination and noted: "At no time was [Hunt] ever the Chief, or Acting Chief, of a CIA Station in Mexico City.Released in the Fall of 1975 after the Rockefeller Commission's report, Weberman and Canfield's book Coup d'Etat in America reiterated Szulc's allegation. In July 1976, Hunt filed a $2.5 million libel suit against the authors, as well as the book's publishers and editor. According to Ellis Rubin, Hunt's attorney who filed the suit in a Miami federal court, the book said that Hunt took part in the assassination of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.As part of his suit, Hunt filed a legal action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in September 1978 requesting that Szulc be cited for contempt if he refused to divulge his sources. Three months earlier, Szulc stated in a deposition that he refused to name his sources due to "the professional confidentiality of sources" and "journalistic privilege". Rubin stated that knowing the source of the allegation that Hunt was in Mexico City in 1963 was important because Szulc's passage "is what everybody uses as an authority ... he's cited in everything written on E. Howard Hunt". He added that rumors that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy assassination might be put to end if Szulc's source was revealed. Stating that Hunt had not provided a sufficient reason to override Szulc's First Amendment rights to protect the confidentiality of his sources, United States District Judge Albert Vickers Bryan Jr. ruled in favor of Szulc.

On November 3, 1978, Hunt gave a security-classified deposition for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. He denied knowledge of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. (The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) released the deposition in February 1996.) Two newspaper articles published a few months before the deposition stated that a 1966 CIA memo linking Hunt to the assassination of President Kennedy had recently been provided to the HSCA. The first article, by Victor Marchetti – author of the book The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence (1974) – appeared in the Liberty Lobby newspaper The Spotlight on August 14, 1978. According to Marchetti, the memo said in essence, "Some day we will have to explain Hunt's presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963." He also wrote that Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and Gerry Patrick Hemming would soon be implicated in a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy.
The second article, by Joseph J. Trento and Jacquie Powers, appeared six days later in the Sunday edition of The News Journal, Wilmington, Delaware. It alleged that the purported memo was initialed by Richard Helms and James Angleton and showed that, shortly after Helms and Angleton were elevated to their highest positions in the CIA, they discussed the fact that Hunt had been in Dallas on the day of the assassination and that his presence there had to be kept secret. However, nobody has been able to produce this supposed memo, and the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States determined that Hunt had been in Washington, D.C., on the day of the assassination.Hunt sued Liberty Lobby – but not the Sunday News Journal – for libel. Liberty Lobby stipulated, in this first trial, that the question of Hunt's alleged involvement in the assassination would not be contested. Hunt prevailed and was awarded $650,000 damages. In 1983, however, the case was overturned on appeal because of error in jury instructions. In a second trial, held in 1985, Mark Lane made an issue of Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination. Lane successfully defended Liberty Lobby by producing evidence suggesting that Hunt had been in Dallas. He used depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, G. Gordon Liddy, Stansfield Turner, and Marita Lorenz, plus a cross-examination of Hunt. On retrial, the jury rendered a verdict for Liberty Lobby. Lane claimed he convinced the jury that Hunt was a JFK assassination conspirator, but some of the jurors who were interviewed by the media said they disregarded the conspiracy theory and judged the case (according to the judge's jury instructions) on whether the article was published with "reckless disregard for the truth." Lane outlined his theory about Hunt's and the CIA's role in Kennedy's murder in a 1991 book, Plausible Denial.

Former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin indicated in 1999 that Hunt was made part of a fabricated conspiracy theory disseminated by a Soviet "active measures" program designed to discredit the CIA and the United States. According to Mitrokhin, the KGB created a forged letter from Oswald to Hunt implying that the two were linked as conspirators, then forwarded copies of it to "three of the most active conspiracy buffs" in 1975. Mitrokhin indicated that the photocopies were accompanied by a fake cover letter from an anonymous source alleging that the original had been given to FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley and was apparently being suppressed.

According to Kerry Thornley, who served with Oswald in the Marine Corps and wrote the biographical book The Idle Warriors about him before the assassination of the president (the manuscript was seized during the investigation and was kept as physical evidence for a long time), Thornley regularly met with a man in New Orleans known to him as Gary Kirstein, with whom they discussed the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Also, according to Thornley, Kirstein in those years wanted to organize the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and planned to "frame a jailbird for it." In "Confession to Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK by Kerry Thornley as told to Sondra London" he said that after Watergate, when photos of Howard Hunt appeared in the media, he found that he was very similar to his acquaintance Kirstein, along with whom they discussed organizing the assassination of the president.

After Hunt's death, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. Notes and audio recordings were made. In the April 5, 2007, issue of Rolling Stone, St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Atlee Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, Antonio Veciana, William Harvey, and an assassin he termed "French gunman grassy knoll" who many presume is Lucien Sarti.  The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain and furthermore falsified accounts of Hunt's supposed confession. The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be "inconclusive".

Hunt's memoir, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond, was ghost-written by Greg Aunapu and published by John Wiley & Sons in March 2007. According to the Hunt Literary Estate, Hunt had intended to write an update to his 1974 autobiography Undercover and supplement this edition with post-9/11 reflections, but by the time he had embarked on the project, he was too ill to continue.  This prompted John Wiley & Sons to search for and hire a ghost writer to write the book in its entirety.  According to St. John Hunt, it was he who suggested to his father the idea of a memoir to reveal what he knew about the Kennedy assassination, but the Hunt Literary Estate refutes this as scurrilous.The foreword to American Spy was written by William F. Buckley Jr. According to Buckley, he was asked through an intermediary to write the introduction but declined after he found that the manuscript contained material "that suggested transgressions of the highest order, including a hint that LBJ might have had a hand in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy." He stated that the work "was clearly ghostwritten", and eventually agreed to write an introduction focusing on his early friendship with Hunt after he received a revised manuscript "with the loony grassy-knoll bits chiseled out".Publishers Weekly called American Spy a "breezy, unrepentant memoir" and described it as a "nostalgic memoir [that] breaks scant new ground in an already crowded field". Tim Rutten of the Los Angeles Times said it was "a bitter and self-pitying memoir" and "offers a rather standard account of how men of his generation became involved in intelligence work".  Referencing the book's title, Tim Weiner of The New York Times wrote: "American Spy is presented as a 'secret history,' a double-barreled misrepresentation. There are no real secrets in this book. As history it is bunk." Weiner said that the author's examination of the Kennedy assassination was the low-point of the book, indicating that Hunt pretended to take various conspiracy theories, including the involvement of former President Johnson, seriously. He concluded his review describing it as a work "in a long tradition of arrant nonsense" and "a book to shun". Joseph C. Goulden of The Washington Times described it as a "true mess of a book" and dismissed Hunt's allegations against Johnson as "fantasy". Goulden summarized his review: "I wish now that I had not read this pathetic book. Avoid it."Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Daniel Schorr said "Hunt tells most of his Watergate venture fairly straight". Contrasting this opinion, Politico's James Rosen described the chapters regarding Watergate as the "[m]ost problematic" and wrote: "There are numerous factual errors – misspelled names, wrong dates, phantom participants in meetings, fictitious orders given – and the authors never substantively address, only pause occasionally to demean, the vast scholarly literature that has arisen in the last two decades to explain the central mystery of Watergate." Rosen's review was not entirely negative and he indicated that the book "succeeds in taking readers beyond the caricatures and conspiracy theories to preserve the valuable memory of Hunt as he really was: passionate patriot; committed Cold Warrior; a lover of fine food, wine and women; incurable intriguer, wicked wit and superb storyteller." Dennis Lythgoe of Deseret News said "[t]he writing style is awkward and often embarrassing", but that "the book as a whole is a fascinating look into the mind of one of the major Watergate figures". In National Review, Mark Riebling praised American Spy as "the only autobiography I know of that convincingly conveys what it was like to be an American spy." The Boston Globe writer Martin Nolan called it "admirable and important" and said that Hunt "presents a livelier, tabloid version of the 1970s". According to Nolan: "It is the best moment-by-moment depiction of the June 17, 1972, burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters I have ever read."

Hunt's first wife, Dorothy Louise (née Wetzel) Day Goutiere Hunt, was born on April 1st, 1920, in Dayton, Ohio. Wetzel was an employee for the Central Intelligence Agency in Shanghai, later serving as a Marshall Plan secretary to W. Averell Harriman in Paris. Hunt and Wetzel raised Saint John, Lisa, Kevan, and David. Wetzel was killed in the December 8, 1972, crash of United Airlines Flight 553 in Chicago. Congress, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash, and concluded that the crash was an accident caused by crew error. "Much more than" $10,000 in cash was found in Dorothy Hunt's handbag in the wreckage.

Hunt later married schoolteacher Laura Martin, with whom he raised two more children, Austin and Hollis. Following his release from prison, he and Laura moved to Guadalajara, Mexico, where they lived for five years. Afterwards they returned to the United States, where they settled in Miami, Florida.

On January 23, 2007, he died of pneumonia in Miami. He is buried in Prospect Lawn Cemetery in his hometown of Hamburg, New York.

A fictionalized account of Hunt's role in the Bay of Pigs operation appears in Norman Mailer's 1991 novel Harlot's Ghost. Hunt was portrayed by Ed Harris in the 1995 biopic Nixon. In the 2019 film The Irishman, Hunt is portrayed by stage actor Daniel Jenkins. In the 2022 series Gaslit, Hunt is portrayed by J. C. MacKenzie. Canadian journalist David Giammarco interviewed Hunt for the December 2000 issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine. Hunt later wrote the foreword to Giammarco's book For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films (ECW Press, 2002).
An episode of The X-Files, entitled "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", depicted the shadowy intelligence operative played by William B. Davis as an unsuccessful author of mystery/suspense fiction in his spare time. When meeting Lee Harvey Oswald, prior to the JFK assassination, he goes by the alias 'Mr. Hunt.'In the 2023 HBO miniseries White House Plumbers, Hunt is played by Woody Harrelson.

Deposition for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978). Released in 1996.The Watergate scandal was a political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1974 that led to Nixon's resignation. The scandal stemmed from the Nixon administration's attempts to cover up its involvement in the June 17, 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Washington, D.C., Watergate Office Building.
After the five perpetrators were arrested, the press and the Department of Justice connected the cash found on them at the time to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Further investigations, along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars, led the House of Representatives to grant the U.S. House Judiciary Committee additional investigative authority—to probe into "certain matters within its jurisdiction", and led the Senate to create the U.S. Senate Watergate Committee, which held hearings. Witnesses testified that Nixon had approved plans to cover up his administration's involvement in the burglary, and that there was a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office. Throughout the investigation, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, and this led to a constitutional crisis. The Senate Watergate hearings were broadcast "gavel-to-gavel" nationwide by PBS and aroused public interest.Several major revelations and egregious presidential actions obstructing the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Nixon had to release the Oval Office tapes to government investigators. The Nixon White House tapes revealed that he had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the burglary and had later tried to use federal officials to deflect attention from the investigation. The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. With his complicity in the cover-up made public, and his political support completely eroded, Nixon resigned from office under Section 1 of the 25th Amendment on August 9, 1974. It is generally believed that, if he had not done so, he would have been the second president impeached by the House, after Andrew Johnson in 1868, the first federal official impeached since Halsted Ritter in 1936, and the first and only one to be removed from office by a trial in the Senate. He is the only U.S. president to have resigned from office. On September 8, 1974, his successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him.
There were 69 people indicted and 48 people—many of them top Nixon administration officials—convicted. The metonym Watergate came to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration, including bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious; ordering investigations of activist groups and political figures; and using the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Internal Revenue Service as political weapons. The use of the suffix -gate after an identifying term has since become synonymous with public scandal, especially political scandal.

On January 27, 1972, G. Gordon Liddy, Finance Counsel for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP) and former aide to John Ehrlichman, presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's acting chairman Jeb Stuart Magruder, Attorney General John Mitchell, and Presidential Counsel John Dean that involved extensive illegal activities against the Democratic Party. According to Dean, this marked "the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency".Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, Mitchell approved a reduced version of the plan, including burglarizing the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation, but has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates, which included former CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell had by then resigned as attorney general to become the CRP chairman.In May, McCord assigned former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin III to carry out the wiretapping and monitor the telephone conversations afterward. McCord testified that he selected Baldwin's name from a registry published by the FBI's Society of Former Special Agents to work for the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon. Baldwin first served as bodyguard to Martha Mitchell—John Mitchell's wife, who was living in Washington. Baldwin accompanied Martha Mitchell to Chicago. Eventually the committee replaced Baldwin with another security man.On May 11, McCord arranged for Baldwin, whom investigative reporter Jim Hougan described as "somehow special and perhaps well known to McCord," to stay at the Howard Johnson's motel across the street from the Watergate complex. Room 419 was booked in the name of McCord's company. At the behest of Liddy and Hunt, McCord and his team of burglars prepared for their first Watergate break-in, which began on May 28.Two phones inside the DNC headquarters' offices were said to have been wiretapped. One was Robert Spencer Oliver's phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman Larry O'Brien. The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged; however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver's phone. While successful with installing the listening devices, the committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs. They plotted a second "burglary" in order to take care of the situation.Sometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard Frank Wills noticed tape covering the latches on some of the complex's doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked. He removed the tape, believing it was nothing. When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had retaped the locks, he called the police. Responding to the call was an unmarked police car with three plainclothes officers (Sgt. Paul W. Leeper, Officer John B. Barrett, and Officer Carl M. Shoffler) working the overnight "bum squad"—dressed as hippies and on the lookout for drug deals and other street crimes. Alfred Baldwin, on "spotter" duty at the Howard Johnson's hotel across the street, was distracted watching the film Attack of the Puppet People on TV and did not observe the arrival of the police car in front of the Watergate building, nor did he see the plainclothes officers investigating the DNC's sixth floor suite of 29 offices. By the time Baldwin finally noticed unusual activity on the sixth floor and radioed the burglars, it was already too late.The police apprehended five men, later identified as Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis. They were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. The Washington Post reported the day after that "police found lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence ... a shortwave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35 millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns". The Post would later report that the actual amount of cash was "[a]bout 53 of these $100 bills were found on the five men after they were arrested at the Watergate."The following morning, Sunday, June 18, G. Gordon Liddy called Jeb Magruder in Los Angeles and informed him that "the four men arrested with McCord were Cuban freedom fighters, whom Howard Hunt recruited". Initially, Nixon's organization and the White House quickly went to work to cover up the crime and any evidence that might have damaged the president and his reelection.On September 15, 1972, a grand jury indicted the five office burglars, as well as Hunt and Liddy, for conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws. The burglars were tried by a jury, with Judge John Sirica officiating, and pled guilty or were convicted on January 30, 1973.

Within hours of the burglars' arrests, the FBI discovered E. Howard Hunt's name in Barker and Martínez's address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the "White House Plumbers", which was established to stop security "leaks" and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman ordered him to "deep six" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and the FBI's Acting Director L. Patrick Gray (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.
Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, in which Nixon asked, "Who was the asshole that did that?" However, Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.A few days later, Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, described the event as "a third-rate burglary attempt". On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, "I can say categorically that ... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident." On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, "The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there."

Martha Mitchell was the wife of Nixon's Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, who had recently resigned his role so that he could become campaign manager for Nixon's Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). John Mitchell was aware that Martha knew McCord, one of the Watergate burglars who had been arrested, and that upon finding out, she was likely to speak to the media. In his opinion, her knowing McCord was likely to link the Watergate burglary to Nixon. John Mitchell instructed guards in her security detail not to let her contact the media.In June 1972, during a phone call with United Press International reporter Helen Thomas, Martha Mitchell informed Thomas that she was leaving her husband until he resigned from the CRP. The phone call ended abruptly. A few days later, Marcia Kramer, a veteran crime reporter of the New York Daily News, tracked Mitchell to the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, and described Mitchell as "a beaten woman" with visible bruises. Mitchell reported that, during the week following the Watergate burglary, she had been held captive in a hotel in California, and that security guard Steve King ended her call to Thomas by pulling the phone cord from the wall. Mitchell made several attempts to escape via the balcony, but was physically accosted, injured, and forcefully sedated by a psychiatrist. Following conviction for his role in the Watergate burglary, in February 1975, McCord admitted that Mitchell had been "basically kidnapped", and corroborated her reports of the event.

On June 19, 1972, the press reported that one of the Watergate burglars was a Republican Party security aide. Former attorney general John Mitchell, who was then the head of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP), denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in. He also disavowed any knowledge whatsoever of the five burglars. On August 1, a $25,000 (approximately $175,000 in 2022 dollars) cashier's check was found to have been deposited in the US and Mexican bank accounts of one of the Watergate burglars, Bernard Barker. Made out to the finance committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by Kenneth H. Dahlberg. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.
Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.
Donations totaling $86,000 ($602,000 today) were made by individuals who believed they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it through the Federal Reserve Check Clearing System.
The banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.
The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, Hugh Sloan.
As a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the finance committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.
Liddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972 to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.
All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as attorney general, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the President was re-elected in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.

Chief among the Post's anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as Mark Felt, deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, The Washington Daily News and other publications.During this early period, most of the media failed to understand the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election. Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein's scoops; the crosstown Washington Star-News and the Los Angeles Times even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the Post's articles. After the Post revealed that H.R. Haldeman had made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and the Philadelphia Inquirer failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House's denial of the story the following day. The White House also sought to isolate the Post's coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the New York Times and Time magazine.After it was learned that one of the convicted burglars had written to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. Time magazine described Nixon as undergoing "daily hell and very little trust". The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the Vietnam War. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to "get" (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations. Such actions had been taken before. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of Newsday, after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of Charles "Bebe" Rebozo, a friend of Nixon.The Administration and its supporters accused the media of making "wild accusations", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration. Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter Baruch Korff that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, "Watergate would have been a blip." The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.

Rather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. "Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974." On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. In an attempt to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.
Urged by Nixon, on March 28, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General Richard Kleindienst that nobody in the White House had had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.John Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees' recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorneys. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were both later indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired White House Counsel John Dean, who went on to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.Writing from prison for New West and New York magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

In one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Because Attorney General Kleindienst, though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatsoever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General. The Counsel to the President, John Dean, has also resigned.
On the same day, April 30, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular Justice Department hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named Archibald Cox to the position.

On February 7, 1973, the United States Senate voted 77-to-0 to approve 93 S.Res. 60 and establish a select committee to investigate Watergate, with Sam Ervin named chairman the next day. The hearings held by the Senate committee, in which Dean and other former administration officials testified, were broadcast from May 17 to August 7. The three major networks of the time agreed to take turns covering the hearings live, each network thus maintaining coverage of the hearings every third day, starting with ABC on May 17 and ending with NBC on August 7. An estimated 85% of Americans with television sets tuned into at least one portion of the hearings.On Friday, July 13, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel Donald Sanders asked White House assistant Alexander Butterfield if there was any type of recording system in the White House. Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally admitted there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and others, as well as Nixon's private office in the Old Executive Office Building.
On Monday, July 16, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel Fred Thompson asked Butterfield whether he was "aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president". Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his executive privilege as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.

On October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon's order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job". Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.
These actions met considerable public criticism. Responding to the allegations of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 Associated Press managing editors at Disney's Contemporary Resort, on November 17, 1973, Nixon emphatically stated, "Well, I am not a crook." He needed to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor; Bork, with Nixon's approval, chose Leon Jaworski to continue the investigation.

On March 1, 1974, a grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the "Watergate Seven"—H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell, Charles Colson, Gordon C. Strachan, Robert Mardian, and Kenneth Parkinson—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a president can be indicted only after he leaves office. John Dean, Jeb Stuart Magruder, and other figures had already pleaded guilty. On April 5, 1974, Dwight Chapin, the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted Ed Reinecke, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of California, on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where "expletive deleted" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.Initially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President Gerald Ford said, "While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand." The Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said the transcripts revealed a "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral" performance on the part of the President and his former aides. The House Republican Leader John Jacob Rhodes agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he "ought to consider resigning as a possible option".The editors of The Chicago Tribune, a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, "He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal." The Providence Journal wrote, "Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean." This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.

The issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled unanimously (8–0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.

The tapes revealed several crucial conversations that took place between the president and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a "cancer on the presidency". The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: "That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice." Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: "...  just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have—handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon? ... you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options".At the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: "Well ... they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid." During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.On December 7, investigators found that an 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.

Nixon's position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the House of Representatives approved H.Res. 803 giving the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate impeachment of the President. On July 27, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted 27-to-11 to recommend the first article of impeachment against the president: obstruction of justice. The Committee recommended the second article, abuse of power, on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: contempt of Congress. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rep. 93–1305, which included the text of the resolution impeaching Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.

On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had a meeting in the Oval Office during which they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing its investigation of the break-in, as they recognized that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal might be revealed.
Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

... the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have ... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas ... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: "the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this ... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'"Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: "All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest." Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: "You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it."Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.Before the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as John Mitchell. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, Fred Buzhardt and James St. Clair, that "the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years". The tape, which Barber Conable referred to as a "smoking gun", proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.
In the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.

The release of the smoking gun tape destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House. Additionally, John Jacob Rhodes, the House leader of Nixon's party, announced that he would vote to impeach, stating that "coverup of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated".On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House; indeed, by one estimate, no more than 75 representatives were willing to vote against impeaching Nixon for obstructing justice. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal–not even half of the 34 votes he needed to stay in office.
Faced with the inevitability of his impeachment and removal from office and with public opinion having turned decisively against him, Nixon decided to resign. In a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.
... I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

... I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.
The morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, "As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?" At Andrews, he and his family boarded an Air Force plane to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.

With Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility at the federal level. Nixon was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had "committed or may have committed or taken part in" as president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family's situation "is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."Nixon continued to proclaim his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he "was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy".Some commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford's loss of the presidential election of 1976. Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on October 17, 1974.In his autobiography A Time to Heal, Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

Haig emphasized that these weren't his suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his. [emphasis in original] ... Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.

Charles Colson pled guilty to charges concerning the Daniel Ellsberg case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the Committee to Re-elect the President was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974. On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.
Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977. Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.The Watergate scandal resulted in 69 government officials being charged and 48 being found guilty, including:
John N. Mitchell, Attorney General of the United States who resigned to become Director of Committee to Re-elect the President, convicted of perjury about his involvement in the Watergate break-in. Served 19 months of a one- to four-year sentence.
Richard Kleindienst, Attorney General of the United States, convicted of "refusing to answer questions" (contempt of court); given one month in jail.
Jeb Stuart Magruder, Deputy Director of Committee to Re-elect the President, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to the burglary, and was sentenced to 10 months to four years in prison, of which he served seven months before being paroled.
Frederick C. LaRue, Advisor to John Mitchell, convicted of obstruction of justice. He served four and a half months.
H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff, convicted of conspiracy to the burglary, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Served 18 months in prison.
John Ehrlichman, White House Domestic Affairs Advisor, convicted of conspiracy to the burglary, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Served 18 months in prison.
Egil Krogh, United States Under Secretary of Transportation, sentenced to six months for his part in the Daniel Ellsberg case.
John W. Dean III, White House Counsel, convicted of obstruction of justice, later reduced to felony offenses and sentenced to time already served, which totaled four months.
Dwight L. Chapin, Secretary to the President of the United States, convicted of perjury.
Maurice Stans, United States Secretary of Commerce who resigned to become Finance Chairman of Committee to Re-elect the President, convicted of multiple counts of illegal campaigning, fined $5,000 (in 1975 – $27,200 today).
Herbert W. Kalmbach, personal attorney to Nixon, convicted of illegal campaigning. Served 191 days in prison and fined $10,000 (in 1974 – $59,300 today).
Charles W. Colson, Director of the Office of Public Liaison, convicted of obstruction of justice. Served seven months in Federal Maxwell Prison.
Herbert L. Porter, aide to the Committee to Re-elect the President. Convicted of perjury.
G. Gordon Liddy, Special Investigations Group, convicted of masterminding the burglary, original sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Served 4+1⁄2 years in federal prison.
E. Howard Hunt, security consultant, convicted of masterminding and overseeing the burglary, original sentence of up to 35 years in prison. Served 33 months in prison.
James W. McCord Jr., convicted of six charges of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping. Served two months in prison.
Virgilio Gonzalez, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 13 months in prison.
Bernard Barker, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 18 months in prison.
Eugenio Martínez, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 15 months in prison.
Frank Sturgis, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 10 months in prison.To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state bar associations or courts), the American Bar Association (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing Model Code of Professional Responsibility (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983, the ABA replaced the Model Code with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Model Rules have been adopted in part or in whole by all 50 states. The Model Rules's preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved law schools take a course in professional responsibility (which means they must study the Model Rules). The requirement remains in effect.On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a grand jury. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the 18+1⁄2-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Aided by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the historian Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the Nixon White House tapes, sued for the release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Kutler's request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal. They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.Texas A&M University–Central Texas professor Luke Nichter wrote the chief judge of the federal court in Washington to release hundreds of pages of sealed records of the Watergate Seven. In June 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice wrote the court that it would not object to their release with some exceptions. On November 2, 2012, Watergate trial records for G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord were ordered unsealed by Federal Judge Royce Lamberth.

According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at University of Texas at Austin, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a "minor footnote".When Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended state of emergency since 1950. Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the "-gate suffix".

Disgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the November 1974 Senate and House elections, which took place three months after Nixon's resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed "Watergate Babies"). Congress passed legislation that changed campaign financing, to amend the Freedom of Information Act, as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the Ethics in Government Act). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.
Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the 1976 presidential election against Jimmy Carter.In 1977, Nixon arranged an interview with British journalist David Frost in the hope of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished. The 2008 movie Frost/Nixon is a media depiction of this.
In the aftermath of Watergate, "follow the money" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book All the President's Men and did not become associated with it until the movie of the same name was released in 1976. The 2017 movie Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House is about Felt's role in the Watergate scandal and his identity as Deep Throat.
The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011. In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site's significance would be memorialized within the new complex.

Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the United States v. Liddy trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns. The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of Larry O'Brien, the DNC chairman. However, O'Brien's name was not on Alfred C. Baldwin III's list of targets that was released in 2013. Among those listed were senior DNC official R. Spencer Oliver, Oliver's secretary Ida "Maxine" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.Based on these revelations, Texas A&M history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of The New York Times, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless the information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.In 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President Hubert Humphrey to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by Howard Hughes to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, Donald Nixon, was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked John H. Meier, an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the 1960 presidential election campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment. From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.Meier told Donald Nixon that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.James F. Neal, who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon's surprised reaction when he was told about it.

Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam referred to the American presidency's "parlous position" without the direct wording of the Watergate scandal during Question Time in May 1973. The following day responding to a question upon "the vital importance of future United States–Australia relations", Whitlam parried that the usage of the word 'Watergate' was not his. United States–Australia relations have been considered to have figured as influential when, in November 1975, Australia experienced its own constitutional crisis which led to the dismissal of the Whitlam Government by Sir John Kerr, the Australian Governor-General. Max Suich has suggested that the US was involved in ending the Whitlam government.

Chinese then-Premier Zhou Enlai said in October 1973 that the scandal did not affect the relations between China and the United States. According to the then–Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj of Thailand in July 1975, Chairman Mao Zedong called the Watergate scandal "the result of 'too much freedom of political expression in the U.S.'" Mao called it "an indication of American isolationism, which he saw as 'disastrous' for Europe". He further said, "Do Americans really want to go isolationist? ... In the two world wars, the Americans came [in] very late, but all the same, they did come in. They haven't been isolationist in practice."

In August 1973, then–Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka said that the scandal had "no cancelling influence on U.S. leadership in the world". Tanaka further said, "The pivotal role of the United States has not changed, so this internal affair will not be permitted to have an effect." In March 1975, Tanaka's successor, Takeo Miki, said at a convention of the Liberal Democratic Party, "At the time of the Watergate issue in America, I was deeply moved by the scene in the House Judiciary Committee, where each member of the committee expressed his own or her own heart based upon the spirit of the American Constitution. It was this attitude, I think, that rescued American democracy."

Then–Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in August 1973, "As one surprising revelation follows another at the Senate hearings on Watergate, it becomes increasingly clear that the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), today is in no position to offer the moral or strong political and economic leadership for which its friends and allies are yearning." Moreover, Lee said that the scandal may have led the United States to lessen its interests and commitments in world affairs, to weaken its ability to enforce the Paris Peace Accords on Vietnam, and to not react to violations of the Accords. Lee said further that the United States "makes the future of this peace in Indonesia an extremely bleak one with grave consequence for the contiguous states". Lee then blamed the scandal for economic inflation in Singapore because the Singapore dollar was pegged to the United States dollar at the time, assuming the U.S. dollar was stronger than the British pound sterling.

In June 1973, when chairman Leonid Brezhnev arrived in the United States to have a one-week meeting with Nixon, Brezhnev told the press, "I do not intend to refer to that matter—[the Watergate]. It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were "weakened" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's "realistic and constructive approach to Soviet Union–United States relations ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".

Talks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.

Iranian then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi told the press in 1973, "I want to say quite emphatically ... that everything that would weaken or jeopardize the President's power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world."

An unnamed Kenyan senior official of Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, "American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a back seat [sic]."

Cuban then-leader Fidel Castro said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by the Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were "probably the least of [them]".

After the fall of Saigon ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May 1975 that, if the scandal had not caused Nixon to resign, and Congress had not overridden Nixon's veto of the War Powers Resolution, North Vietnam would not have captured South Vietnam. Kissinger told the National Press Club in January 1977 that Nixon's presidential powers weakened during his tenure, thus (as rephrased by the media) "prevent[ing] the United States from exploiting the [scandal]".The publisher of The Sacramento Union, John P. McGoff, said in January 1975 that the media overemphasized the scandal, though he called it "an important issue", overshadowing more serious topics, like a declining economy and an energy crisis.
