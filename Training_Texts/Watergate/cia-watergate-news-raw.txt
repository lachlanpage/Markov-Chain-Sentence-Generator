Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140061-1 WASHINGTON POST 18 April 1973 0 By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Weshfncton Poat staff writers President Nixon announced.yester= day that there were "major develop- ments" in, . the.Watergate case and, in a reversal of .his earlier position,- he has agreed to allow his aides to testify; under oath before a Senate committee that is investigating the,affair. The President said he personally "be- gan intensive new inquiries into this whole matter" on March 21 and that "real progress has been made in find- ing the truth." Where previously the President had stated that ? no members of the Write :House staff were involved in the bug- ging of Democratic headquarters, yes, terday he told reporters: "If any person in the executive ,branch' or in the government is in- dicted by the grand jury, my policy will be to immediately suspend him. 'If he is convicted, he will of course,, be automatically discharged." The President's statement was in sharp contrast to 10 months of White I-louse denials of involvement of presi-. dential aides in the Watergate bugging and other ,political espionage and sabo-? tage activities. ? Following Mr. Nixon's brief talk, presidential press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler met.-with reporters and said that all previous White House state-. ments about the bugging were "inoper- ative." Ziegler emphasized: "The Presi-, dent's statement today is the operative statement." Meanwhile, reliable g o v e r n m e n t sources said yesterday that two or three former presidential aides and ad- ministration officials are .currently the focus of the Justice Department's crim- inal investigation and will probably be ,indicted by the federal grand jury in-, vestigating the Watergate espionage. At the same time, White house and Justice Department sources said de- velopments in the case are likely to lead to the resignation of at least two, high White House officials believed by the President to be either directly or indirectly responsible for the Water- gate bugging and other political cspio- ?nage and sabotage. ' One White House aide Said yesterday that the President's language about the possible indictment of persons in the executive branch was carefully chosen and based on knowledge of im- pending indictments. Until yesterday, the President was adamant In. his refusal to allow his aides to testify before a "formal ses- sion" of a congressional committee. He said last month they had "executive privilege" to refuse to disclose confi- dential White House business, and that lie would welcome a court test on the issue. The Senate Watergate committee, led by its chairman. Sen. Sam J. Ervin 'gi kc~ n r Jr. (D-N.C.), was just as insistent in de- manding that presidential aides testi fy under oath and in public. Ervin, said that executive privilege 'could not be invoked in investigations ,of wrongdoing and threatened to ar- rest presidential aides and try them for oontempt of the Senate. if they re- ? fused 'subpoenas. "All members of the White House staff will appear voluntarily when re- quested by the committee," the Presi- dent said yesterday. "They will testify under oath and they will answer fully all proper questions." Mr. Nixon said that his 'aides could still invoke execu- tive privilege-but only on individual questions. Ervin has not disputed this. The President presented his state- ment during a meeting with reporters. It followed weeks of demands by lead- ing Republicans that he speak out about the Watergate and came on a day when the Los Angeles Times re- ported that the President was about to make a dramatic admission of high- level responsibilty for the Watergate- type espionage. ? The first reaction by Republicans to ,the ]resident's statement was favor- able. Sen. Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.), the vice chairman of the Senate invest- igating committee, said of Mr. Nixon's announcement, "We now have the biggest hurdle behind us.' "I'm highly pleased with the Presi- dent's decision," Baker said, "I think it was a good one. I can't resist saying that I've always contended that we - would have White House aides testify, along with everyone else who known anything about this matter. I aifi de- lighted that that optimism now seems' justified. The President has made the determination to re-evaluate the entire. situation, and I commend him for it.". Mr. Nixon said he began his own in- vestigation March 21 "as a result of serious charges which came to my at., tention." ' Ziegler said the President was re-- ferring in part to sworn testimony by" Watergate conspirator James W. Mc- Cord, who has said superiors told him' that at least three presidential asso-. ciates had advance knowledge of the Watergate bugging: former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, presidential: counsel John W. Dean III and former presidential assistant Jeb Stuart Ma- gruder. now a Commerce Department official. Ziegler repeatedly refused to discuss the possibility of whether individual members of the White House staff were involved in the bugging or whether they plan to resign. On num- erous occasions he refused to discuss specific inquiries about Dean, who con- ducted an investigation for President Nixon that cleared all then-current members of the White House staff of involvement in the bugging. He added that since March 21, the President has conducted White House r gate,-, sistance of Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen, who has headed the Justice Department's criminal investi- gation of the Watergate casd. Ziegler. indicated yesterday that Dean had effectively been removed from any further assignment to in- vestigate the Watergate case, stating, that the President "felt it was not ap- propriate that any member of the White House staff be involved in fur- ther investigation." Earlier, the President had told re- porters that he met Sunday with Peter- sen and Attorney General Richard G. Kleindierist."to review the facts which had come to me in my investigation and also to review the progress of the, Department of Justice investigation." Mr. Nixon added: "I can report today that there have been major develop- ments in the case concerning which it would be improper to be more specific now, except to say that real progress has been made in finding the truth." The President then announced that he will suspend any person in the ex- ecutive branch who might be indicted in the case. "I have expressed to the appropriate authorities my view that no individual holding, in the past or at present, a position of major importance in the ad- .ministration should be given immunity from prosecution," the President said. Ziegler told reporters that the Presi- dent has had "extensive discussions ,with members of the (White House) staff about the situation," but stressed. that Mr. Nixon.now "has looked to Mr. Petersen"-not his own staff-to assist in further investigation. Ziegler was repeatedly asked if he stood by his earlier denials that Dean and White House chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman had advance knowl- edge of the Watergate bugging. He de-' clined to answer on grounds that he. would not discuss individuals. When asked specifically about the President's Aug. 29 statement that no* one then on the White House staff was involved in the Watergate mat- ter, Ziegler said, "That was a state- ment prior to today's . . ?. The state- ment today is the operative state- ment.". When pressed on the reliability of his own statements, Ziegler said they were based on information available at the time, prior to when the Presi- dent . began his own "intensive new inquiries into this whole matter." Ziegler was reminded that Presi- dent- Nixon called White House coup= sel Dean on March 26, and expressed confidence in him. Ziegler, on the same day, had said that Deab was innocent of any involvement in the Watergate bugging. Asked if he stands behind his statement, Ziegler said: Approved For Re ase 28u1)'0'8/6 "ebFth t- 09432R000100140001-~1 a "Pe 01. >ne .  Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140001-1 President's 'statement, It would ' be in- appropriate for me to discuss any indi- vidual." Asked whether the White House, duties of either Haldeman or Dean had been altered because of recent developments in the Watergate case, Ziegler said: "'I'm not going to focus on any individual today" and warned reporters that "my refusal to do so should not imply anything." Later, the press secretary said `that , "everyone in the White House staff is in their jobs as previously," and that their duties remain unchanged ex- cept for the President's directive that no 11'h6. ]louse aides be involved in further investigation of the Watergate case. Ziegler refused to say whether the 'President's statement about possible ,criminal action against members of the executive branch applied only to .the. Watergate bugging or to related allegations of widespread political es- pionage and sabotage activities as well. Expanding on a previous White House statement that President Nixon dâ€¦1 will become a scapegoat in the shore up by implicating John has also a knowlednse to assn- tons of materials-including; f11'atergate case.

"It's wishful thinking on their part if they think they can get away with that," the asso- ciate said. Another associate described Dean's statement that he will not be a scapegoat as "just the first salvo from John." In its editions yesterday, The Washington Post report- ed that former presidential assistant Magruder had pro., vided federal prosecutors with a first-hand account of a Feb-~ ruary, 1972, meeting in then-I Attorney General Mitchell's office to discuss and approve the bugging operation at the Watergate. Those who attend. ed the meeting were Mitchell, Dean, Magruder and convict. Ad Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy, according to several sources' accounts of Magruder's statements to the prosecutors. Yesterday, one associate of Dean said the presidential counsel had confirmed that he attended such a meeting at which the bugging was dis- cussed, but contended that Dean argued against the it- leral eavesdropping operation and refused to have anything to do with it. Afterwards, the associate said, Dean was. ordered by su- periors in the White House to handle arrangements for pay- ing the seven indicted Water- gate conspirators to remain silent. R1ag.uder, according to White House sources, has said that both Dean and Mitchel made the arrangements to buy, the conspirators' silence is ,addition to approving plans for ,the bugging. Mitchell, asked in New York about yesterday's story in The Post, told' the Associated Press: "This gets a little sillier as it goes along, doesn't it? I've had a good night's sleep and haven't heard any of this non- sense." Magruder, the deputy direcc- tor of the Nixon re-election campaign, was scheduled to testify yesterday before the federal grand jury investigat.- ing the case, but reporters at the U.S. Courthouse did not see him there. Federal prose- cutors last night refused to discuss whether Magruder had appeared before the grand jury, or when he is scheduled to testify. It is known that, in addition to the bugging itself, the grand jury is investigating al- legatlons of obstruction of justice and perjury by pres- ent and former presidential aides. Meanwhile, Washington at- torney Peter H. Wolf added new mystery to the Watergate investigation yesterday by say. ing that a client of his had taken eight cartons of mater. ials from convicted Watergate conspirator Hunt's office the day after the Watergate break-1 in last June and had held on to them until just before thel election. Wolf said, that included in, the boxes were the "plans to 'bug' the Watergate" as well as contributors' lists that were later "turned over by the Com- mittee (for the Re-election of ,the President) in the litigation instituted by Common Cause." In his motion filed in U.S. District Court, Wolf said he was attempting to determine whether he has a lawyer-client' relationship or whether he must testify before the grand jury. Wolf did not identify his client, other than to say he "worked for the Committee for Re-election of the Presi- dent." The lawyer also did not dis- close who had given his client the orders to pick up the ma- terials-and hide them. Wolf said the client had come to him to ask "whether he was in danger 'of violating 'any law if he'had hidden in his possession approximately eight cardboard cartons con- taining, among other things, the contents of Hunt's desk in the White House before the FBI got there, including plans to 'hug' the Watergate." The attorney said he hall urged his client to "turn over these documents to people conducting investigations of. the Watergate matter." Wolf said that his client came to him late last summer and "very shortly after this I telephoned principal assistant U.S. Attorney Earl J. Silbert and received from him an opinion that he did not think my client was commit- ting any crime." Silbert responded yesterday that Wolf's motion was "pre- posterous." Silbert said Wolf's "implication that evidence of this nature would be ignored (by me) is incredible." Silbert said the conversa- tion last summer involved the propriety of Wolf's client turn- ing over materials relevant to the Common Cause suit and that no mention was made of where the materials came from. "It was only a few days ago that Dlr. Wolf disclosed to us that his anonymous client had obtained t h e s e, documents from llr. Hunt's office," Sil- bert said. I Wolf said his client "had' been asked" by an unnamed' party to pick up the cartons from Hunt's office in the Ex- ecutive Office Building and ,,that a pass would be waiting for him at the guard entrance, that no questions would be' asked when the cartons were; removed from the building,, and none were." Hunt's attorney, William O.! Bittman, said yesterday that, Hunt ,to the best of my knowledge, didn't have any documents in his office except' in the. safe." He said he was unaware of Wolf's allegations. In another. development, 'an aide to Sen. Lowell P. I Weicker, Jr., (R-Conn.) said yesterday that a locked filing cabinet in his (the aide's) of- fice containing records of In- vestigations into the Water gate case and related matters Washington Post 11 April 1973 Lost Put' at, 86o2 Efli'loon Associated Press Sen. William Proxmire (D- Wis.) said yesterday the U.S. intelligence community em- ploys about 148,000 persons and spends about $6.2 billion each year. Renewing his call for dras- tic cuts In the cost of Ameri. can spying and covert activi- ties overseas, Proxmire urged James Schlesinger, new Cen- Atral Intelligence Agency Dl- Irector, to make public the gov- ernment's entire intelligence budget, which has always been secret. Proxmire said he Is not op- posed to a first-rate American intelligence operation but does believe that the Intel ligenee establishment has swollen out of proportion tol national defense needs and that congressional controls and restraints on it have eroded. . He said his cost and man. Power estimates are not based on classified or official sources and noted that they, apparently was opened during the night. William Wickens, a counsel. to Weicker, said it was impos sible to determine immedi- ately whether anything was missing from the cabinet but; that it was possible 'some of the records might have been. Photographed or copied. A Xe-i rox machine is located about 51 feet from the cabinet, Wickens! -said. depict the CIA as smaller iii' both personnel 'and budget than at least three other U.S. intelligence groups. Proxmire's estimates show the CIA with a work force of 15,000 and an annual budget of $750 million. These are his, other estimates: National Security Agency, 20,000 and $1 billion; Defense Intelligence Agency, 5,016 and $100 million; Army Intelli- gence, 38,500 and $775 million; Navy Intelligence, 10,000 and $775 million; Air Force Intelli- gence, 60,000 and $2.8 billion, and State Department Intelli- gence, 335 and $8 million. Proxmire said his estimates are "not without' error," but nevertheless are "in the ball- park." "These figures do not re- flect, however, the coordina- tion that is involved from one organization to another," Proxmire said. "The Air Force, for example, supplies the launch boosters and satel- lites for the highly successful reconnaissance program and this is one reason the budget. is so high." Proxmire has said . previ.' ously that secret missions by intelligence agencies overseas are needlessly Involving the United States In the political affairs of other countries at a period when the need for the missions has been greatly re- duced by modern techniques of electronic and aerial sur- veillance.

In related developments yesterday: ? Three principal figures in an alleged campaign:of politi- cal espionage and sabotage conducted against the Demo- crats appeared before the same grand jury as McCord yesterday. They are former presidential appointments see-' retary Dwight L. Chapin, for- mer White House aide Gordon Strachan. and alleged political saboteur Donald II. Segretti. 111 ? Reliable investigative sources said that Mitchell and iformer commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans, the chief Nixon campaign fund-raiser, appeared earlier this month before a federal grand jury in New York City investigat him final typed transcripts of wiretapped conversations on several occasions and said; "These are for. the (former) at- torney general.", On at least one occasion. McCord report- edly 'testified, Liddy specifi cally told him that he regu- larly "hand-carried" the tran- scripts to Mitchell, who was then President Nixon's cam- paign manager. On another occasion, Mc- Cord reportedly testified, he saw Liddy's secretary, Sally Harmony,.typing a final ver slon of the transcripts from' MrC ord's own preliminary' draft. One source familiar with the testimony said yesterday: "If those conversations were being retyped, it meant they had to he going somewhere; Liddy certainly didn't need to have them typed again for himself."} Miss Harmony. who testified before the Watergate grand year, has been contacted by the Senate select committee investigating the bugging of Democratic headquarters and other political espionage and sabotage, and is expected to be recalled before the grand jury as well. . ,McCord also reportedly told the grand jury that the Water, gate hugging team had plan- ned to install wiretapping and eavesdropping devices at Sen. McGovern's headquarters dur- ing the same weekend that he and four other conspirators were arrested at the Water- ate. The operation at the ontainebleu, he reportedly, testified, was still in the plan ning stages and Liddy told him.that it would be executed as soon as word came from Mitchell. McCord is also known to have told others that the bug- ging team had,planned to wire- tap the campaign headquar- ters ` of : Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) during the spring, but that the plans were; abandoned when' it was clear that Muskie was no longer the front-runner for the Demo- cratic presidential nomination. It could ? not be learned if ? Mc-. Cora who rented an office. next door to Muskie headquar- ters in Washington mentioned that matter to the grand jury.: Like his earlier testimony before the Senate's select in- vestigating committee, Mc- Cord's grand jury statements about the. alleged involvement in wiretapping activities of presidential aides and advisers was based on hearsay-prima- rily in the form' of what he says he was told by Liddy. Liddy has been sentenced to an additional prison term for contempt of court in refusing to answer the grand jury's questions, including those based on what he is saiti to have told McCord. 'The meaning of the appear- ance ance by former presidential appointments secretary ' Cha- pin, former White House aid Strachan and alleged agent provocateur Segretti before the Watergate grand jury yes- terday was not immediately clear, One federal source said their appearance is the first indica- tion that the grand jury inves- tigation may have moved be- vond illegal electronic surveil- lance to include a broad range of political espionage and sab- otage activities. Previously, the Justice Department has main- tained that there was nothing Illegal about the' operations Segretti and Chapin were al- legedly involved in. Some federal sources sug- gested yesterday that Chapin and Segretti were called be- fore the grand jury to estab- lish that they have no knowl- edge of illegal electronic sur- veillance. - tors took unusual steps to pre- vent news reporters from ob- serving who was to appear be-, fore the panel. The prepara-; tions included moving the; grand jury to a different room, accessible from two entrances,' one of which is reachable 'through a hack elevator. ' Assistant U.S, Attorney Earl J. Silbert, who heads the re- newed federal investigation into the Watergate bugging and related matters, said the new arrangements were order- ed because a circus atmos- ,phere had developed outside the other grand jury room, -where reporters have gathered in the last two weeks to watch persons entering and leaving. Despite the new arrange- ments, reporters were able to tdetermine that Chapin was) in the grand jury room for 'about 90 minutes, after which the scurried past reporters, smiling but refusing to answer any questions. Outside the courthouse, he ,entered a brown sports car and sped away. Segretti, who followed him into the closely guarded grand jury room, was there for about. 45 minutes before the grand jury quit for the day at about 5:45 p.m. Prosecu- 1tors refused to say whether Segretti would return for more questioning. It could not be determined how long Strachan, a former political aide to White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman, was before the grand jury. . According to investigators, Chapin and Strachan both played a, role in hiring Segret- ti to engage in political dis- ruption and spying activities. Chapin, according to FBI reek ords made public, also made arrangements for Segretti to he paid by President Nixon's personal lawyer, Herbert W. -Kalmbach, and Strachan al- legedly put Watergate con- spirator Liddy in touch with Segretti to merge two nom- inally separate spying-and- sabotage operations: one run by the White House and the other by the Committee for the Re-election of the 'Presi- dent. Another witness to appear before the grand jury yester- day teas Robert Reisner, a for. mer aide to Jeh Stuart Magru. der, the deputy director of the Nixon re-election, campaign. Reisner, who has also been contacted by the Senate's in- vestigating committee, was presumably before the grand jury yesterday to be asked about McCord's hearsay alle~ gations that . Magruder was among high presidential asso- ciates who had advance knowl- edge of the Watergate hug- ging.

Reisner was expected to he asked by prose. cutors yesterday about some of the leads provided by Mc- Cord. Both Senate and Justice De- partment investigators have confirmed that Mitchell, Dean, Liddy and Magruder were all present during a February meeting in Mitchell's office but have thus far have unable to substantiate that the bug- ging was discussed, WASHINGTON POST 11 April 1973 1M iEteUU Aide $70,000 Of Bug Fund By Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein Waahinaton Pont Staff Writers About $70,000 in cash from President Nixon's campaign i was transferred in apparent violation of the law last July to a principal assistant of ::or- mer Attorney General John N. Mitchell, according to reliable investigative sources. The $70,000-mostly in $100 bills-came from the same ac- count that financed the Water- ' gate bugging and went to for- mer White House aide Fred- crick C. LaRue, one of Mitch- ;ell's closest political aides, the sources said. The purpose of the traimmfer is not yet known, the sources said, but federal investigators are expected to try to deter- mine if the $70,000 was in any way used to pay the Watergate conspirators for their silence, LaRue received the $70.000 two weeks after the arrest of five men June 17 in the De:.no- crats' Watergate headquarters and several days after Mich- ell resigned as the President's campaign manager, the sources said. The transfer was approved by former Commerce Secre- tary Maurice H. Stags, the fi- nance chairman of the Nixon campaign, according to sworn testimony given this month to federal investigators in Now York City. A spokesman for the Cam- mittee for the Re-election of the President, reached yester- DeVan L. Shumway, spokes- man for the Nixon re-election committee, said yesterday that Mitchell does not recall such a February meeting, and, that Mitchell first met Liddy on June 15, 1972, at least three months after - the alleged meeting.' In'seeking corroboration of McCorci's testimony, Senate. sources said yesterday that staff members of the select ,committee have talked to Vicki IChern, Reisner,s secretary at the Nixon committee, and that she provided an appointment book or calendar confirming a scheduled meeting of Mitch- ell, Dcan, Liddy and Magru- der in February. Miss Chern is also under stood to have provided the, committee staff with other in- formation. However, reliable Senate sources discounted pub- lished reports that the com- mittee:.has fours, ai witness who can confirm that the bug-, ging was discussed at the meeting. day afternoon, had no im- mediate comment on the re- port of $70,000 fund. Mitchell, Stans and LaRue could not be reached for comment. The testimony concerning the $70,000 transfer is the first indication that the President's re-election committee contin- ued to maintain a secret ac- count of some sort after the arrests in the Watergate. The General Accounting Of- fice was 'not told of the trans- fer, as required by the new Federal Election Campaign Act, which directs full public accounting of all campaign money after April 7, 1972. Philip S. Hughes, head of the Federal Elections Office in the GAO, responded yester- day ; to an inquiry about the $70,000 by saying: "It seems that the law is loud and clear that all money, in their hands. after April 7 had 'to be fully accounted for. If ti>is money went out in July -and I've never heard of it befdre-I don't think any rea- songble person could argue that, it was not a violation- even Stags hasn't argued, that:-" The $70,000 came from a Tart cash fund that was kept in Stans' office safe and was used to finance a broad cam- pai,,1n of political espionage and 'sabotage. That intelligence-gathering fund, which fluctuated in size between $350,000 and $700,000,' was, the source of at least $235,000 for convicted Water- gate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy, the former finance counsel to the Nixon commit. tee. P In January, the Nixon com- mittee pleaded no contest to eight separate violations of. the new campaign finance dis-' closure law stemming from) the;paYments to Liddy and was'fined $8,000. According to -two sources at thelNixon committee, the $70,- 000- was given to LaRue for noncampaign purposes that are apparently known only to Mitchell, LaRue and other top campaign officials. LaRue was one of two per- sons directed by former Attor-1 ner General Mitchell to keeps the.'public and federal investi- gatitirs from learning many de- tails about the Nixon commit- tee~ involvement in the Watergate bugging, according to llighly placed sources in the Nixon campaign., Meanwhile, federal inve,t H gators in Washington are known to be checking into testimony of convicted Water-1 gate conspirator James W. McCord Jr. that he received: $3,000 a month from the late' wife of coconspirator and for-, mer White House consultant ,E. Howard Hunt Jr. According to reliable sources, McCord received the money in cash-mostly $100 bills-in exchange for 'his si- lence about the Watergate op- ' eration. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Nixon com- mittee, reportedly testified be- fore a federal grand jury here that Dorothy I-Iunt told him ,last year that the $3,000 a month and $1,000 monthly pay. .ments to other conspirators came from the Nixon re-elec- lion committee under an ar- rangement worked out by Kenneth W. Parkinson, the committee's attorney. Parkinson has denied the charge and said it is "totally and completely false." According to sworn testi- mony given to federal investi- gators in New York City, La-' Rue received the money from Hugh W. Sloan Jr., the former. Nixon committee treasurer who resigned abdut the time of the July transfer. The testimony by campaign', committee officials was made to a federal grand jury in New York . City investigating a $200,000 cash contribution to t the Nixon committee by finan- cier Robert L. Vesco. Vesco is charged in a civil! suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission with misappropriating $224 million in mutual funds man- aged by IOS, Ltd., a financial complex based in Switzerland. According to other federal sources, the $200,000 Vesco contribution went into the ocash fund kept in Stags' safe. That fund has been a cen- tral focus of the Watergate in- vestigation and has the follow. ing history: In August, the GAO cited the Nixon committee for 11 apparent violations of the law for failing to report receipts and expenditures from the i fund, which the GAO at the t time said contained at least I$350.000. In ,May, after the new 1$350,000 was deposited in th !bank, apparently liquidatin the fund. determined that at least $12, 000 from the fund (part of th $235,000) was given to th liquidated on May 25. checks, including $89,000 i Mexican checks taken acros the border to conceal th ' utors, went into the cash fund. The checks were cashed by bank'account last April. 0 At least $30,000, whit Donald H. Segretti, an alleged against the Democratic presi dential candidates. Th money was paid to Segretti b Herbert W. Kalmbach, Presi- dent Nixon's personal attor- ney, at the direction of former presidential appointments sec- retary Dwight L. Chapin. O Disbursements from the fund were, according to fed- eral sources, controlled by Mitchell, Stags, Kalmbach, Jeb Stuart Magruder (the No. 2 of- ficial at the Nixon campaign) and White house chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman. The White House has denied that Haldeman controlled disburse. ments from the fund. Hughes, head of the federal elections-office, said yesterday that officials from the Nixon committee have declined to say how much money was in the fund. Reliable sources have said that the fund con- tained close to $1 million. LaRue, once the part owner of a gambling casino in Las Vegas, has been one 'of the most enigmatic figures of the Nixon administration's inner circle since the President took office. During the 1972 cam- paign, he was one of the most important presidential aides placed by the White House in the leadership of the Commit. tee for the Re-election of the President. A wealthy Jackson, Miss., oil man, LaRue was.one of the ar- chitects of the "Southern' Strategy" of the 1968 Nixon) campaign, in which he worked as an assistant to campaign manager iitchell. During the first three years of the Nixon administration, he officially served as a coun- sel to the President, although his name was never listed In the White'House staff. directo- ries, and some lower-level "White House aides still say: "I never heard of him when he was over here."

' Both La Rue and Magruder played roles in the Nixon cam- paign's program of espionage and sabotage activities against the Democrats, . according to campaign and Investigative sources. At the committee, the two shared an office suite and, among campaign Insid- ers, became collectively. known as "MagRue." Magruder has denied alle- gations in hearsay testimony by Watergate conspirator Mc- Cord that he was one of sev- eral former presidential asso- ciates who had a d v a n c e knowledge of the Watergate bugging. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Nixon re-election committee, is known to have told investi- gators that he has no knowl- edge that LaRue was involved lin the bugging. According to Alfred C. Bald win III, the ex-FBI agent and WASHINGTON POST Mitchell security guard who monitored the wiretapped con- versations of Democrats at the Watergate, his hiring by .the 'Nixon committee was person. Ally approved by LaRue. Bald- win, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, said he was supplied with a gun by LaRue, who told him not to worry about not having a li- cense. 11 At the time of the Water- gate arrests on June 17, Mitch: ell, Magruder, LaRue and Robert C. Mardian, former As- sistant Attorney General, were all together on the West Coast, according to investiga- tive and Nixon committee sources. Mitchell reportedly ordered Magruder to fly di- rectly back to Washington on Sunday, June 18, to investi- gate the situation. Then 'Mitchell returned to Washington with LaRue and Mardian on Monday or Tues- day, and designated them as coordinators of the Nixon committee's response to the bugging, including responsibil- ity for dealing with federal in- vestigators. Part of that response, ac- cording to Investigators, was a massive "housecleaning" or- dered by LaRue and Mardian, in which numerous records were destroyed. Mardian also sat in on almost all FBI inter- j'views with Nixon committee employees and, with LaRue, reportedly advised some per- sons to "stay away from cer? twin areas" in their discussions with investigators. the conspiracy. On one, or more occasions, .McCord reportedly testified, .11Irs. Hunt told him she flew to Miami to pay. those de tfendants while they were awaiting trial. In January,' -Frank A. Sturgis, one of the. Miami men, was quoted in The New York Times as say- ';ing the four were still being ',paid but would not say who was supplying the cash. McCord, according to the' ?.sources, testified that Mrs. 'Hunt had become increasingly `disturbed about her role in al- vlegedly paying off the defend- rants to keep silent, and dis- ,`cussed the matter with him on tseveral occasions. 'McCord reportedly told the grand jury that Mrs. Huntap ;geared certain that the money kwas coming from the re-elec- ition committee, either directly or indirectly through Parkin- ,:son. On several occasions, Mc- 'Cord is said to have told the ,grand jury, Mrs. Hunt told shim that the arrangements for the payoffs had been made through Parkinson. During the Watergate trial, Hunt and the four Miami men pleaded guilty to all the, charges against them. McCord and his principal superior in f the conspiracy, former White House aide G. Gordon Liddy, were convicted without taking the witness stand. Liddy has continued to remain silent, since his conviction and has received an additional prison sentence for contempt of court after refusing to answer a grand jury's questions. At the time the four Miami men pleaded guilty, sources close to those defendants re- ported that each had been receiving $1,000 a month since their arrest and that Hunt had promised them they would continue to receive the money if they followed his lead and pleaded guilty. Hunt, a for- mer White House consultant, told the men they would even- tually be granted executive clemency if they remained silent, according to the sources. The sources said they were aware of how the $1,000 a month was being distributed but refused to disclose the details. Parkinson, the principal at- torney for the Committee for the Re-election of the Presi- dent, is a partner in the Washington law firm of Jack- son, Laskey & Parkinson. Last October, Alfred C. Baldwin III, the ex-FBI agent and Nixon committee security guard who monitored the wiretapped conversations of Democrats in their headquar-, ters at the Watergate, told The Los Angeles Times that Park- inson inson had urged him to take the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury investigating the case. Justice Dcpartment. sources said at the time that! they could not substantiate the allegation by Baldwin, who cooperated with the prosecution and became a key government witness in the case. , Parkinson, 45, graduated inl* 1952 from the George Wash-i ington University Law School. 10 April 1973 MCord: `lush' Money Came From Hunt's Wife By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward wnshinaton Post 9tnff writers Watergate conspirator James W. McCord Jr. has tes- tified before a federal grand jury that Ire received $3,000 a month from the late wife of his coconspirator, E. Howard Hunt Jr., to remain silent about his role in the bugging .of Democratic headquarters, according to reliable sources. McCord, the former security coordinator of the Committee for the Re-election of the Pres- ident, reportedly testified that Dorothy L. Hunt told him the $3,000a month carne from the re-election committee under an arrangement worked out by Kenneth W. Parkinson, the committee's attorney. Parkinson called the charge "totally and completely false.'- Tlunt's attorney, William O. liittman, declined to cony ment, saying he had no in- formation to either confirm or deny the substance of AIc- Cord's allegations. McCord reportedly testi- fied that Mrs. Hunt, who was killed in an airplane crash in Chicago last December, told' him she usually received Nix on committee money from an intermediary for Parkinson and that she then distributed' the cash to the Watergate de- fendants. At the' time of her, death,' Mrs. Hunt was carrying $10,- 01)0 in $100 bills, which D'Ic- Cord reportedly testified was part of a payoff to her hus-, band for remaining silent. about the Watergate conspir-acy ATcCord said Mrs. Hunt was taking the money to Chi- cago to invest it in a motel, according to reliable sources. Hunt also has said the money was for investment purposes. According to sources famil- iar with McCord's grand jury testimony, he said he was told by Mrs. Hunt that- she was also paying four other defend- ants in the case-the Miami men arrested inside the 1\'atcrgate with McCord on June 17 - $1,000 per month each to remain silent about He has been active in Legal Aid and, Neighborhood Legal Services programs here. Meanwhile, L a w r e n c e Young, the California attorney who first disclosed the contact between alleged political sabo- teur Donald H.' Segretti and the White House, charged yes- terday that there is an at- tempt to "muzzle" him. Young said he had received a letter from Segretti's attor- (ncy warning that any commu-1 nications between Young and' Segretti are covered by a law- yer-client privilege of confi= rdentiality "and are not to be discussed by you under any. circumstances." Young denied a lawyer- client relationship with See retti and said he views the at- tempt to keep him quiet as an' indication that Segretti will refuse to cooperate .with the Senate select committee inves- tigation the Watergate bug-. ging and related allegations of, political espionage and sabo- tage. Young said the letter from ,Segretti's lawyer was dated April 4, two weeks after an in-; vestigator from the select' committee had asked Young for additional information about Scgretti. The letter, which Young said was signed by John P. Pollock, a Los Angeles attor- ney for Segretti, told Young that he was not to discuss any- thing regarding Segretti's "actions, persons with whom he' was associated, places where he traveled and all other aspects of his work." Last fall Young told The Washington Post in a series of ;Washington that Segretti had told him that Dwight L. Cha- pin, President Nixon's appoint- ments secretary, and Water. - gate bugging conspirator L. Howard Hunt Jr. were his con- tacts in spying and sabotage operation. .Young, Segretti and Chapin'. ,were all friends in the early 1960s when they attended the University of Southern Cali- fornia together. The letter directs Young not to repeat any of his earlier statements or make any addi- tional'disclosures. "I deny any lawyer-client relationship," Young said yes- terday in a telephone inter- view from Los Angeles. "I re- ceived no legal fees and asked Segretti three times if he wanted to retain me and he said 'no' each time." Young said the letter, com- ing more than five months af- ter his first public disclosures about Segretti's activities, is the first indication, that Se- gretti might claim that their conversations were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.

The FBI summary said that Herbert W.

In a related development 'yesterday, Mary Lou Burg, care Hla" 8 Qehttao ng Convicted Watergate con- spirator James W. McCord Jr. has testified under oath that his hiring as security coordi- nator for the Committee for the Re-election of the Presi- dent was apparently cleared through White House counsel John W. Dean III. ? The White House said last night that Dean has "no recol- ?lect.ion of ... being involved In the hiring of McCord." Dean, who recommended ,that watergate conspirator G. `Gordon Liddy be hired by the' ire-election committee, is one of the high presidential aides .who McCord has said he was told had advance knowledge of the bugging of Democratic .headquarters. In a sworn deposition to at- torneys for ' the President's re-election committee, McCord said that he. was first con- tacted in the fall of 1971 about doing security work in the Nixon campaign, and that the contact was made by Alfred Wong, the special agent In charge of the White house Se- cret Service detail. Wong, according to Mc- Cord's testimony, told him that if he was interested In a job in the campaign -someone would call him later.

McCord's deposition to law- yers for the committee is I being taken as part of one of the civil suits,arising from the June 17 break-in at the, Watergate. At one point in the deposi- tion McCord refused to say if he had any tape recordings in his possession that might be relevant to the bugging con- spiracy, after' being advised by attorney Henry B. Roth- blatt not to answer the ques- tion until being granted im- munity from further prosecu- tion. McCord was granted such immunity on Thursday, and Is' expected ~o answer the ques-' tion when the deposition 'con- tinues next week. Another attorney for Mc- Cord, Bernard Fensterwald, said the only tapes that he knows are in McCord's posses- sion are recordings of lectures. for classes he gave in securityl work at Montgomery Junior College. At another point in the deposition, McCord said he took notes about activities "in' the security area" while at the' Nixon re-election committee! and has since turned some ofj them over to a grand jury in- vestigating the Watergate bug-~ ging. I McCord also said that for a? two-week period in April he went daily to the apartment of: former Attorney General] Mitchell to pick up the Mitch- ells' daughter and drive her to school because Mrs. Mitch. ell feared, she might be 'harmed. He said he would often meet, Mitchell or Mrs. Mitchell or' 'their maid, there, although, Mitchell has said under oath he only met McCord once ?-~ at the re-election committee -? . except to pass him in the hall at the committee. Mrs. Mitchell, McCord testi- fied, was so concerned about ' the family's security, including the possibility of being wire-' tapped or bugged, that he once X-rayed all the furpiture in the Mitchell's apartment, after she ,received a death threat over her unlisted telephone. Mc- Cord said he also had a tele- phone company security officer check out the Mitchell's tele phones. McCord himself said he has been the target of a telephoned bomb threat since agreeing to -disclose all he knows about the Watergate conspiracy and pos- sibly other related illegal ac- tivities.

Colson,, former spe- with the campaign of espion- cial counsel to President Nixon; age and disruption that was h as voluntarily taken a private lie-detector test in New York to buttress his sworn testimony that he had nothing to do with the Watergate raid last summer. Ciose friends of Mr. Colson 'in New York disclosed that Richard O. Arther, president of Scientific Lie Detection, Inc., who is an authority in his field, conducted the test and con- cluded on Wednesday that Mr. Colson had "truthfully" deniedl all foreknowledge of the plot. Mr. Arther and Mr. Colson's personal lawyer, who helped to prepare the examination re- 'fused to elaborate on the ques- tions asked and the results. Mr. Colson was unavailable. reportedly directed from thel White House against several Democratic Presidential candi- dates last year. Mr. Colson's resort to the' lie detector, believed to be the: first of its kid in the Water- gate case, appeared to signal a new eagerness among.,mem- bers of the President's inner circle to document their inno- cence. The 41-year-old Mr. Colson has consistently denied all in-' volvement in the break-in at the Democratic party head- quarters at the Watergate com- plex last June 17.

Mr. Colson branded the hearsay charge a "goddamned lie." Referring to a grand jury appearance last summer, a sworn deposition in a civil suit and an interview with the Fed- eral Bureau of ? Investigation, Mr. Colson repeated, "I've testi- fied under oath three times that I had no knowledge of it." But with his name' in the headlines again, and with the search for masterminds con- tinuing, he decided last week on a lie detector test as a way to clear his name. I ? He was also concerned, friends say, about the effect of rumors on his law practice. Partners in his New Law firm, Colson & Shapiro, which has hired 10 new lawyers in anttici- pation of the business that Mr. Colson could attract, also urged him to undergo the test. New York associates of Mr. Colson who have read the test results say that he was,asked to state whether he had any knowledge of the bugging of the Democratic National Com- mittee offices before June 17, 1972, when five invaders were captured, with their electronic recording equipment, in the Watergate office building. He was also asked to say whether he had been telling the truth earlier when he denied all in'- .volvement. On these and three other closely related questions; Mr. Arther, the examiner, is reliably understood to have concluded that Mr. Colson was "truthful in all respects." Gene Sandacz, a vice presi- dent of Mr. Arther's company, said today that David I. Shapiro, 'Mr. Colson's law partner and R 0 -M -_nlr.on AT de By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward Washington Post Staff Writers White House chief of staff H. R. (Bob) Haldeman, the man who controls the flow of both paper and people to the President, is losing his cherished anonymity as his' name becomes entangled in the Watergate affair. The Senate has estab- lished a special select com- mittee to investigate the- Watergate bugging a n d other related acts of politi- cal espionage and sabotage and a federal grand jury has renewed its inquiry. . Sources familiar with both investigations say that final understanding of the widespread undercover ac- tivities of the 1972 Nixon campaign is largely de- pendent on determining Haldeman's role in those events. These are the known ele- ments about the President's No. 1 aide and the Water- gate, as pieced together from sources in the FBI, Justice Department, White House, Senate, the Commit. tee for the Re-election of the President and the Rep- ublican Party:, ? To date, Investigators have developed?no hard evi- dence involving Haldeman In the electronic eavesdrop- ping at the Watergate or other illegal activities. ? Haldeman told an off- the-record meeting with some Republican congress- men last month that he personally o r d e r e d the "surveillance" of Demo- cratic presidential candi- dates, including the taping of their speeches and public statements and gave the impresison that the opera- tion somehow "got out of hand." (One congressman at the meeting said he took this to mean that Haldeman acknowledged setting up the operation from which the Watergate bugging stemmed.) ' ? Haldeman effectively ran the President's reelec- tion committee, a creation of the White House, and put his own trusted aides in most of the key positions of responsibility there. ? Most of the men alleged to have played central roles in a broad campaign of po. litical espionage and sabo- tage - among them former presidential appointments secretary Dwight L. Chapin, deputy Nixon campaign di- rector .Jeb Stuart Magruder, and former presidential assi-. tant Gordon Strachan - had previously worked di, his legal adviser in this case, had helped to frame the ques- tions in a - manner that also briefed Mr. Colson in advance on the wording of the questions. Independent experts in the use of the polygraph, or lie de- tector, said today that the prep- aration of subjects on the con- tent of their examination was, standard procedure-that-helped, to heighten the sensitivity of the test. Mr. Colson, a tough-talking, ex-marine, has in the past seemed to take pride in his reputation as President Nixon's "hatchet man." He once said that he would do "anything Richard Nixon asked-me to do -period." Takes Credit For `Leak' He took credit for leaking the. report, hinting - at conflict of interest, that helped to defeat Senator Joseph D. Tydings, a Maryland Democrat, in 1970. And he was proud last year to, have nursed the White House alliance with the International fund were his own lieuten- ants. The White House has denied that Haldeman con- trolled disbursements from the fund. ? During a campaign strategy meeting in late 1971, Haldeman told then- Attorney General John N. Mitchell that certain secu- rity operations then under White House and Justice Department jurisdiction should be transferred to the Committee for the Reelec- tion of the President. One result of that decision was the transfer of Watergate conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt Jr. from the White House staff where they investi- gated news leaks, to the Committee for the Re-elec- tion of the President. ? Three of the four men named by convicted Water- gate conspirator James. W. 1'IcCord Jr. as allegedly hav- ing advance knowledge of the bugging are present or former Haldeman deputies.

The teamsters union endorsed the Republican President last year and recently hired Mr. Colson's law firm as its Wash- ington counsel. In a famous memo to his staff in the White House, Mr. Colson wrote last August, "I would walk over my grand- mother if necessary" to re-elect the President. However, he has vehemently and repeatedly de- nied that the.watergato hreak- in was his project.

Since the arrest of five men inside Democratic headquarters on June 17, Haldeman-with President Nixon, former Attorney General Mitchell and White, House Counsel Dean-have been almost the sole archi- tects of the White House re-' sponse and carefully worded denials of the allegations loosely gathered under the term "Watergate," According to sources in the Nixon administration and federal law enforce- ment agencies, the Water- gate bugging stemmed from a broad campaign of politi- cal espionage and sabotage conceived in the White House in 1971, before Presi- dent Nixon emerged as the clear. favorite to be re- elected. Several sources, including past and present members of the White 'House staff,, have said that the clandes- tine activities represented a basic strategy to attempt to determine the person the Democrats would nominate as their presidential candi- date.

Last fall, one highly placed source in the' Justice Department described the overall, well-financed pro- gram of espionage and sabc- tage as "a Haldeman opera- tion."

Stans, the Nixon campaign finance' chairman. In its report, The Post had made an incorrect attrib- ution to grand jury testi- mony by one of his former White House assistants,' Nixon committee treasurer Hugh W. Sloan Jr. This ap- parently was the allusion made by Haldeman to the report being "messed . . up" by The Post. Highly placed sources in. both the Justice Department and the Committee for the Re-election of the President have subsequently recon-, firmed the substance of the- account, and in the words of one person with first-hand knowledge.. of the operation of the fund, identified Haldeman as "the guiding hand" behind the expendi-. tures from the fund, From that fund, Magru der, who was Haldeman's hand-picked choice to serve as interim manager of the Nixon re-election campaign until it was taken over by John Mitchell, authorized the payment of more than $200,000 to convicted Water- gate conspirator Liddy. In addition, Liddy re- ceived an additional $35,000 from the fund from another, former member of Halde- man's White I-louse staff, Herbert L.

Haldeman's principal' White House political aide during the 1972 campaign, Gordon Strachah, has also left the presidential staff in the wake of news reports linking him to the hiring of Segretti, a University of Southern California class- inate of Chapin. According to federal in- vestigative sources, Stra- chan put Watergate conspir- ator Liddy in touch with Segretti to merge two politi- .cal spying and sabotage op-, erations that until then were nominally separate one run by Hunt and Liddy at the Nixon re-election committee, and the other in- volving Segretti and the White House.

"Liddy had planned for the meeting very carefully and had drafted out in longhand budget figures ' for various items of expense, and had dis- cussed them and certain de- tails of the overall operation with Jeb Magruder (who) re- portedly set up the meeting with Mitchell." McCord's carefully worded memo says he believed Liddy was planning to send or hand carry the plans "to someone in the White House. I do not know to whom he took it." As Liddy recounted It to McCord, the crucial Justice Department meeting was "set up for one particular day, but was cancelled, and reset for a day or so later" McCord's statement says Liddy spent about $7,000 to have four-by-four-foot charts drawn up for the meeting.

According to court papers filed by Hunt, two note- books-said by his attorneys, to contain names and ad- -dresses that could have been. used as investigative tools in: the Watergate probe-were, not among the items re- ceived by the FBI. . During the period while: Dean was holding the mate- rial from Hunt's safe,- he: told an FBI agent that he, did not know whether Hunt, had a White House office, prompting Acting FBI Di- rector L. Patrick Gray to tell. the Senate ? Judiciary Com-, mittee that Dean "proba?bly" lied 'to the bureau. In the wake of June 17 break-in at the Watergate, President Nixon has said he. appointed Dean to conduct a, .White House investigation. to determine if members. of, .the presidential staff were. 'involved in the bugging op-, eration. That investigation, which absolved all then-current White House personnel, was "a direct pipeline i to Halde- man," according to one of the few Justice Department officials familiar with its de. tails. Watergate conspirator Mc- Cord, during his appearance before the Senate 'select` committee, was asked if he' ' knew whether Haldeman had anything to do with the gathered In Mitchell's office in the afternoon, as McCord recalled it and "from what Liddy told me it lasted an hour or more." Liddy, according to McCord, said that the discussions at the Justice Department "covered the pros and corts of various ;bugging type operations. No I decisions were made at the 'meeting . but the impres- sion Liddy had seem(ed) to be 'that the operation would be approved." Within a few days, "Dean told Liddy that a way would have to be worked out to un- dertake the operation without directly Involving the Attor- ney General so that he would have deniability about it at a future date. "Dean told Liddy at this time that the funding for the operation would subsequently, come to him through other; than regular Committee for the Re-Election (of the President) funding mecha- nisms so that there would be Watergate bugging, ` and' replied: "I have no knowl- edge of it, no knowledge of it if he did." Nonetheless, several news-' papers mistakenly reported that McCord had implicated Haldeman.- Meanwhile, Sen. Lowell' Pr Weicker (R-Conn.), a fresh: man senator and member of the Watergate select, com-? mittee, cited highly placed, Republican Party sources ? and charged last week that, Haldeman had condoned the. Nixon campaign's overall es-rt pionage and sabotage opera: tions. The result, said Weicker,, was "an almost competitive' attitude as to who could do the dirtiest deed" at the Committee for the Re-oleo-; tion of the ,President. Dc' manding Haldeman's resig-, nation, Weicker said the- White House chief of staff "clearly has to accept re- sponsibility" for what occur- red during the campaign. But last Wednesday, Sen: Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), chair-` man of- the Senate commit- tee on Watergate, issued a statement about Haldeman that Senate sources said was' designed to keep his com-' mittee clear of any charges of innuendo in its investiga Lion. Said Ervin: "In the interest of fair.: ness and Justice, the com mittee wishes to state pubes licly that as of this time it has received no evidence of any nature linking Mr. Haldeman with any illegal' activities in connection with the presidential campaign of 1972." . lan'm", r .no record of it ..."

Of the two, Liddy was most inclined to brag and drop names. + The funds for the Water. gate break-in and - bugging were distributed by Hunt, who always dealt in cash. After his cohorts were caught at gunpoint inside Democratic Party headquarters, he contin. ued to dole out cash to pay the legal and living expenses of the defendants. But there- atergate 'after, Hunt's superiors never contacted him directly but de- livered money through his wife, Dorothy, who was killed in a Chicago airliner -crash with $10,000 in her purse.

James McCord, the mem- ber of the Watergate conspir- acy who is now talking, worked with the White House staff as a CIA agent. One source told us McCord's CIA activities brought him into di- rect contact in the 1950s with Richard Nixon, then the Vice President. McCord has ac- knowledged that he was hired as President Nixon's security, chief for the 1972 campaign through his old White House contacts. Investigators de- scribe McCord as solid, hon- est, intensely patriotic, with an almost fanatic hatred of communism. 0 Despite an outward ap- pearance of amity, Hunt and Liddy were jealous of each other, each vying with the other to bring off more spec.: tacular coups.

And Justice De- partment sources are con- vinced that a man who would hold his hand over a candle flame will sit it out as long as necessary in a jail cell. White House aides, mean- while, are spreading the story that Liddy is mentally unbal- anced and promoted the whole Watergate adventure himself. This kind of talk could back- fire and bring Liddy out of his jail cell with an angry rebut- tal. We have carefully investi- gated the possibility, however, that Liddy may have recruited the Mission Impossible team and ordered the Watergate break-in strictly on his own to satisfy Ibis romantic bent. We established that he had huge pictures of himself be- side a police car, gun and flashlight at the ready; that he threatened to kill people who crossed him; that he terrified the youngsters in his neigh- borhood once by leaping out at them "like Batman" from a garage roof. My associate Jack Cloherty talked to parents and children, in Liddy's neighborhood. They said he sent his own children to bed before dark and be- came agitated when the neigh. borhood kids, made noise around his house. He berated them, chased them and, on one occasion, leaped upon them from a hid- ing place on the garage roof. Another time, he lay in wait, for some loudly talking teen- agers, jumped them and slap- ped one of them around. After this incident, a delega- tion of parents called on him to complain about his abuse of the neighborhood children. They noted that his guns were prominently displayed on the dining room table throughout] their visit. Others who know Liddy de- scribe him as mentally sharp, if slightly eccentric.

' Liddy's father, Sylvester, Liddy, a respected New York i attorney, also described the i rumors about his son's mental! instability as "nauseating" and denounced the portrayal of t the younger Liddy "as flaky, self-promoting adventurer." We have also established that money was delivered by higher-ups to pay the legal, and living expenses of the break-in crew after they were caught. at gunpoint in Demo. cratic Party headquarters. This suggests that the highet+ ups, whoever they are, recog? nixed their responsibility fot the Watergate crimes.

R cC'ord Tells of aternate ~'ayment~ By Jack Anderson In secret testimony before the grand jury, Watergate defendant James McCord has confided that his co-conspira- tor, Howard Hunt, last July feared the President's cam- paign chiefs were abandoning 1them and wrote a three-page 'letter demanding "to contact someone in the White House." Thereafter, money allegedly was delivered to Hunt's attor- ney, William O. Dittman, for distribution to the defendants. Mrs. Hunt, acting as the cour- ier, arranged to meet McCord at various places and slip him cash payments. McCord testi- fied that he received around $45,000 after the Watergate break-in for "salary" and legal expenses. The grand jury Is trying to track down who authorized the payments and whether the money was intended to buy the defendants' silence. Bri'h- cry to obstruct justice, of course, is a serious federal vio- lation. As McCord related it to the grand jury, he received a phone call around July 20 from Hunt. "He asked me," said McCord, "to go to a pay phone away from the house. !'Afraid We Might Talk' "He felt the Committee to Re-elect the President (was) trying to do him in and to do us in for good and to put us away and abandon us.

Testified McCord: "(Hunt) said, 'we have legal fee money for you.' And I said, 'What goes along with it?' He put it this way, 'Everybody's naturally inter- ested in knowing whether you're going to keep quiet."' McCord felt this was merely a maneuver to keep him quiet until the election, 'so he put off Hunt until Nov. 7. Then'he decided "to go ahead and take the legal fee money." But he refused to be bound if, the le- gal fees were offered "as a weapon to keep us from. say- ing anything." The question came up again at a meeting with Mrs. Hunt on Nov. 30. As McCord inter- preted the conversation, "essentially there wasn't going to be any more money unless you fellows agree to plead guilty and take executive clemency at a later time and keep your mouth shut." He quoted her as saying, Cher' Hunt nor McCord would,, go along with that cover story. Then there was talk about,, blaming the whole affair" on Gordon Liddy, the Watergate" ringleader.

McCord said he, too, felt "they were more inter- ested in keeping us in jail than they were in getting us out, because they were afraid we might talk." McCord later learned from Mrs. Hunt that her husband had written a three-page letter which, was read to the I cam- paign committee's . attorney, Kenneth W. Parkinson. Re- counted McCord: ."She said that 'when Bittman. read the letter to Parkinson that Hunt wanted to contact someone in the White House, Parkinson said, 'Give us a week.' And Hunt came back and said, 'No you get two days.' "So they said, 'Okay. Some- thing will be worked out in a couple of days.' And that something, It appeared to me, had to do with a contact and it also had something to do with the funding for the defendants Not long afterward, Mrs. 'Hunt, .using the code name "Chris," called to arrange the first transfer of funds. "I went over to her car and she gave me an envelope and she said, 'This is the payment for your salary 'for five months, begin- ning in July through whatever it is'-I think It was Novem- ber... "I asked her if she wanted a receipt and she said, no, it was not necessary, that she would be making an accounting to Mr. Bittman for it." McCord also talked to her about legal fees. "They want to, know" she reported back to him later, "if you're. going to keep quiet." "They want to know if more, than one year is okay with yon ... staying in jail more than' one year, and then executiv4- clemency." McCord turned. down the deal saying he was going to plead not guilty and, fight the case. "And she re; peated this to me three more, times," he recalled, "and''1.t was in the context of 'Well, Plitt not sure they're going to. give you any more money' .. .

As part 'of the mission, Hunt, a former Central Intelli? gence Agency sleuth, went to the CIA's placement bureau, which willingly provided him with the name of a locksmith skilled in "lockpicking" and opening "a locked room." The locksmith, Thomas Amato, said he'd rather sailboat with his family than spy for the GOP, Hunt testified. The articulate Hunt, who once paid a secret visit to ITT memo-writer Dita Beard in an ill-fitting red wig, said he dis- guised his name during the Miami mission out of habit. As a CIA man he had often trav- eled under false papers In case he was hijacked to Cuba, he said. It was natural, then, that when he went to Miami with Liddy, the same air of mystery that surrounded Hunt's CIA work and his numerous pub- lished thrillers prevailed.

Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who then seemed' to have "a lead" ,among the candidates. Hunt testified that "when Kennedy . would in fact be a candi- tate" was the big question for Liddy, the flamboyant counsel for the Committee for the Re. election'of the President. But Hunt, traveling as "Ed: Warren" and Liddy, as "George Leonard,' had far more in mind than just espio- nage on Kennedy's place in the presidential race. They checked into Miami Beach's plush Playboy Plaza and met with Hunt's old "comrade inj arms," ex-CIA agent Jack Bau-1 man. -What Liddy, who was running the Miami venture, wanted from Bauman was no less than total "Intelligence on everything the Den'ocratsi Approved For Release 2001/08/97 were doing "in terms of politi- cal action," Hunt swore.

The Liddy blueprint also called for spying on those can- didates close to "radical peo- ple," reports on where all can- didates were at all times and how many hotel rooms each candidate's delegations were occupying.

A few days later, Bau- man sat down again with Hunt at the Hay Adams hotel just across Lafayette Park 'from the White House. As Hunt gloomily described it to the grand jury, Bauman said fie "was not going to cooperate" with the master spying scheme. . At about the same time, the conspirators got the bad news on Amato's preference for sailing. 'When the prosecutor asked Hunt why they needed a lockpicker, Hunt said .

After the election; the cash was delivered surreptitiously to a campaign aide, with Haldeman's approval, In an ap- parent violation of the new campaign disclosure law. This is the sworn testimony of Haldeman's loyal former as- sistant, Gordon Strachan, who picked up the money the day before the disclosure law went into effect. He received it from Hugh Sloan, the cam- paign treasurer, but returned it to Fred LaRue, a campaign aide, at his Watergate apart- ment.- It took Strachan 45 minutes, he testified, to. count all the cash. Yet no receipt was asked, and none was given. He quoted LaRue as saying merely: "I'll take care of this." The money was supposed to be used, explained Strachan, for polling. He acknowledged that the President's campaign committee was already con- ducting "a very, very exten- sive polling operation." Yet $350,000 was taken away from the committee and stashed in the White House, he said, "in WASHINGTON POST 20 April 1973 ' "Who told you to go to Mr. LaRue and give him the money?" asked Seymour Glan- zer, an'assistant U.S. attorney.

For example, at one 'point Anderson quotes Mc- Cord as telling the grand jury of a phone call he re- ceived last July 20 from to give it back to you since I got it from you,' but you call Mr. LaRue." First Strachan said it was because Sloan had left, the committee. When asked why he, didn't return It to his suc- cessor, he said: "I honestly don't know." Then Glanzer resumed the questioning. "Have you talked to Mr. Haldeman in the last couple of weeks?" he asked. "Yes I have," replied Stra- chan. "About your appearance be. fore the grand jury?" "Yes I have." "What did you say to him and what did he say to you,'; pressed the prosecutor. - "He told me," replied Stra- chan, "to tell the absolute' truth and to not worry about any political consequences., And those are my orders ...". "Is there any 'reason," de- manded Glanzer, "why Mr,. Haldeman would have to urge, you to tell the truth?"

All three have- protested their Innocence, and the case against them is still largely circumstantial. But witnesses .before the grand jury have given secret testimony, which darkens the cloud over' the trio. The apse against them rests heavily upon Watergate wire- tapiier James McCord's charge that the burglary-bugging op- eration was actually planned 'in Mitchell's Justice Depart- ment. office by Mitchell, Ma- gruder and Dean, with Water- 'gato ringleader G; Gordon Liddy givipg the briefing, On April 2, we quoted from ?McCord's confidential initialed memo that "John Dean, 'Job Magruder, Gordon Liddy and John Mitchell in Feb. 1072 met In Mitchell's office at the Department of Justice : and held the first formal discus- olon of hugging and related op'orationy," - The memo states that Liddy prepared huge . four-feet-by- four-feet charts for the meet- Ing. "The charts were brought In late one afternoon and left in (Liddy's) office on the 4th floor wrapped in brown pa- per," McCord related. Liddy's former secretary, Silvia Panarites, - has con- firmed to the grand jury that a meeting was scheduled. "It was a meeting at the Justice' Department,"' she testified, "among Mr. Liddy, Mr. Magru. der and Mr. Mitchell." Mysterious Package "Now, Miss Panarites," asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Campbell, "did, there come a time when you ob- served a brown package in Mr; Liddy's office?" "Yes, sir," she replied. She described the package as about fours feet in dimension, an inch thick, wrapped In brow>i paper. "Mr. Liddy him- self carried the package into the office ... "? she testified. "He did say that I was not to look in the package; that it was better for me not to know of its contents ... " The mysterious package was left in Liddy's office over- night, she said, so Liddy asked her to hide it in case "somebody should happen to walk in,.it would not be seen .. So I moved the bookcase and put the package behind the bookcase." Another prosecutor, Sey mour Glanzer, asked whether Liddy's removal of the pack. age the next, day was "related in your mind to this appoint.' ment he had at Justice?"

"Gemstone" Papers The most damaging grand jury testimony disputes Ma- gruder's sworn statement that he knew nothing of the Water- gate bugging. Another Liddy secretary, Sally Harmon, testi- fied that she had typed up re- ports on the conversations of Democratic Party officials. She' used secret stationery with the. code word, "Gem- stone," printed on top, she said, She reported that the cam- paign committee's own printer had delivered the "Gemstone" stationery to Liddy's .'office and had cautioned her: "Mr. Liddy said no one is to' see this." After the arrest of the bur- glary-bugging squad at the Watergate, Magruder in . a phone call from California in- structed his assistant, Robert Reisner, to remove sensitive files from his office.

Reisner said he turned .the "Gemstone" folder over ?'to campaign official Robert Odle who later testified he returned it to Magruder without exam- ining it.

While Schlesinger is report- edly embarking on a house cleaning to'cut about a 1,000 persons from the CIA payroll' of about 15,000, he' has given his stamp of approval - at least for the time being - to the military intelligence oper ation, Hall said. "I have told the DCI (Schlesinger) what we are-. doing, what our objectives. are, and how, we are going', about researching them in a broad sense -and he's en-; dorsed them," Hall said. rHE DIA, the key Pentagon intelligence office, underwent a house cleaning of its own beginning in 1970, when Lt. Gc:n. Donald V. Bennett be- came its director. The entire defense intelligence communi. ty has received a further sh king up under Hall. Over the years, there has been a tendency to downgrade the military estimate of the thrc at from other countries -- primarily the Stwiet Union -- and for the civilian analysis of the CIA to be predominant,. Hall said. "On the civilian side - up the river - they were more. inclined to regard the Soviet Union as a more peaceful ent-, THE WASHINGTON POSr Saturday, Apr it 7,1973 Bin gtoua Murry-Go-Roused ity than it actually is. Their tendency is to regard what they (the Soviets) do as a reaction to us," Hall said. .The military picture tends to make the Soviets look like the fierce guys, and that we've got to catch up, he said. "In analysis of the Soviet Union, one was too far on one side, the other too far on the 'other side. I don't want to overstate this, because it was not that bad a situation. But it' would be better if they both moved toward the middle," Hall said.

"It it important to get the' ranges and the circumstances laid out," he said. Unfortunately, he added, many of those who receive the intelligence information would rather have a specific figure than a range" of choices.. l ' FL Burs FBI Water Jack Andersoit The Central Intelligence Agency has ordered Its agents not to talk to the Federal Bu- reau of Investigation about the explosive Watergate case Yet curiously, the CIA has cooperated fully with Sen.

It could mean denying the public the information necessary to under- stand how cost estimates In 47 weap- ons systems rose by over $2 billion between March 31 and June 30 last year. Thus, the Administration's official secrets act would create staggering penalties for disclosure of information even when the information is totally misclassificd or 'classified only to prevent public knowledge of waste, error, dishonesty or corruption. We already have the criminal sanc- itions Nye need against disclosure of true defense secrets.

New penalities will not further deter espionage and spying. They will ,only harm those who want the public to know what the Goverrunent is doing. . . Nothing could be better designed to restrict the news you get to the pasteurized jargon of official press- releases than a law which would punish a newsman for receiving sen- sitive information unless he returned the material promptly to an authorized. official. Nothing could damage'the press more than a provision which would make a newsman an accomplice in. crime unless he revealed. the source of information disclosed to him. - The Administration proposal carries an' even greater danger in the power it would give to the officials who now determine what shall be secret and what shall be disclosed. Not only would they be able to' continue to make those decisions without regard to any real injury disclosure might cause, they would be. empowered to prosecute anyone , who defied their judgment. Their imposition of secrecry could not be reviewed in the courts. And a violation of their decision would be a crime involving not only Govern= ment employees but journalists as well. The, Justice Department proposal goes far beyond any laws we have had, even the emergency requirements of World Wars I and 11. No law now gives the Government such power to prosecute newsmen not only for re- vealing what they determine the public should know but just for possessing information the Government says they. should not have. Under this proposal, a reporter who catches the Government in a lie, who uncovers fraud, who unearths ex- amples of monumental waste could go to jail-even if he could show,-be. yond any question, that the Govern- ment had not right to keep the in- formation secret and that its release could not possibly harm national do 'fcnse. This law then would force journalists to rely on self-serving press releases manufactured by timid bureaucrats- or risk going to jail for uncovering the truth. It would force Government employes to spy on each other. in a manner fa- miliar in Communist or fascist states but abhorrent to our concept- of an. .open democracy, We have had enough of that abuse of secrecy in the attempts to hide the facts about our conduct in Vi'tnam from the American people.

Une 'a bbagton Merry-Go-Hound THE' WASHTNCTON POST Frfdoy, 4prt 6,197s By Jack Anderson, Minutes of a meeting be- tween Secretary of State Bill Rogers and industrial tycoons doing business in Chile quote the Secretary as repeatedly re-, assuring them "that the Nixon', administration was a business administration and Its mission was to protect business." Nevertheless. he refused to retaliate against Chile for ex- propriating American-owned businesses. It is clear front the minutes that he didn't want to oush President Salvador Al- lende into Soviet arms. V----fused Act ai Chile Rogers indicated, according to the minutes, "that he had talked with the Russian For.. eign Minister as to whether or not Moscow was going to fi- nance Chile as It had Cuba. The Russian denied any such Intention. Rogers went on to show grave concern of Rus- sian domination of Latin. America and its impact." The Oct. 22, 1971, meeting. was attended by representa ; tives of International Tele- phone and Telegraph, Ana- conda Copper, Ford Motor, Bank of America, First Na- tional City and Ralston Pu- rina. The minutes were kept by ITT. Most of the angry business- men wanted the U.S. govern. ment to bail them out by tak. lag action against Chile. Only the Ralston Purina representa- tive, whom the ITT minutes describe as a "dove," recom- mended "Ave not cut off ship- ments to Chile but should use private sources to impress Al- lende and his governnient to stay In the Western bloc." The most Rogers would do was consider an "informal em- bargo" and recommend "periodic meetings" on the problem. "The Secretary raised the question," the min- utes state, "of whether there should be an Informal em-, bargo on spare parts and ma- terials being shipped to Chile.; The consensus of the group' was quite mixed. Rogers rec- ommended that there be peri- odic meetings of the group to attempt to solidify a position." The ITT executives went away disgruntled over Rogers' attitude. Concludes the min-1 utes: "In summary, the en-1 tire meeting indicates that the Secretary is pretty much go-' lag along with the . soft. line, low-profile policy -for Latin America."

Further, he testified, he signed any number of state- ments dealing with the security of "top secret" documents. At One point, David R. Nissen, the chief prosecutor, asked him if he had read portions of the Espionage Act referring to classified documents. Dr. Ells- berg answered that "to the best of my knowledge there is noth- ing in the Espionage Act about classified documents, so I couldn't have read them." . He was asked if anyone had given him permission to remove the documents in 1969 from the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, where he was em- ployed, to a Los Angeles ad- vertising office, where he Xer- axcd them at night. , "No," he answered. "No one had given you per- mission to copy them?". ; Mr. Nissen asked. "That is correct," Dr. Ell;;- berg answered. The pledge not to copy tie documents had been disclosed bafn.?e, but this was the first time that it had been disclosed to the jury. Dr. Ellsberg said that the Xeroxing was done in about eight sessions, strating on Sept. 30, 1969, and going into No- vember. On some of those occasions, he said, he worked alone; on others he was helped by An- thony J. Russo Jr., his co-de- fendant. Lynda Sinay was then the owner of the small adver- tising agency, and she helped, he said. So, too, did his son, Robert, then nearly 14 years old, who helped out twice. Once his daughter, Mary, then nearly 11, was at the agency. He was asked whether Miss Sinay or Mr. Russo or his scn Robert had been given official access to the documents, and he answered, No. Nor, he said, had Vu Van Thai, a former South Vietnamese. Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Thai and Miss Sinay are co-conspire- tors but not co-defendants. Dr. Ellsberg told the jury that after each Xerox session he ei- ther returned the documents that evening to Rand or on the next working day. When he copied the papers on a Friday night, he sometimes kept them in his Malibu hone until the following Monday, ter said.

HERSH Spectd to The New York Times WASHINGTON,' April 7- Samuel A. Adams, the Central Intelligence Agency analyst who testified about military de- ceit at the Pentagon papers 'trial, said in an interview to- day that he has apparently been discharged. The agency denied it. Mr. Adams has been persis- tently seeking a formal inquiry into the military's alleged falsi- fication of estimates of Viet- strength of Vietcong and Cam- bodian communists. He was re- cently transferred to another office, in part because of his protests, and thus is no longer directly involved in Southeast Asia intelligence matters. In his appearance at the trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and An- thony J. Russo Jr., Mr. Adams declared that there had been political pressures in the mili- tary to display the enemy as weaker than he actually was." He further charged that he had tong strength in late 1967.

He has yet to- receive any such notification, Mr. Adams said, despite repeated requests to his superiors over the last two weeks. As of the close of work Friday he had heard nothing; he added. The intelligence agency is no win the midst of a 10 per cent staff cutback that was re- cently authorized by its new di- rector, James R. Schlesinger. Those employes with poor per- formancer rating are to be weeded out first, according to some officials. Mr. Adams, 39 years old, who is a direct descendant of the Adams family of colonial times, had served since the mid-nine- A spokesman for the agency said that Mr. Adams was "still on the deck here" and added, "Of course, he has not been ficials in an attempt to kee'_, him from testifying. The thrust of his testimony was that at least some of the highly classified documents in the Pentagon papers, initially published In June, 1971, by The New York Times, were based on inaccurate and perhaps de- liberately misleading informa- tion, thus negating their im- portance to enemy Intelligence officers. In his testimony, the c.LA. official also disclosed that he was involved in 1971 in a simi- lar dispute over the strength of the Cambodian Communist forces. As a result of his re- search, Mr. Adams said at the trial, the estimated number' of Communist troops in Cambodia was officially raised to about 50,000 from, about 10,000.

"What I think happened," Mr. Adams said, "is that some people down at the lower level looked upon the recent staff cutback as an opportunity to finally get rid of me. They probably saw my Ellsberg' tes- timony as heightening the opportunity." Someone at higher levels ap- parently disagreed, Mr. Adams said, and the situation has yet to be resolved. - To resolve it, Mr. Adams be- gan a campaign' to get some official notification of his standing. Last week he wrote the deputy director of intelli- - gence, one of the top officials in the agency, a memorandum urging that he be formally told of his status within 24 hours. "If I have not heard from you by then," the memorandum said, "I will respectfully assume that the decision to declare me in excess is `final, and that I need wait no longer." When the deadline passed, he telephoned a reporter and ar- ranged for an Interview. They! had spoken two weeks earlier,' shortly after he testified In Los Angeles. Mr. Adams said then he was sure that any staff cut- backs in the agency would not affect him. "'They just wouldn't be so dumb as to do that to me now," he declared then. Mr. Adam's friends in the agency have repeatedly pro- fessed admiration for his integ- rity and his willingness to con- tradict official policy to ex- press his point of view. They also note, however, that Mr. In the interview, Mr. Adams professed admiration for the intelligence agency and the work it performs, although he acknowledged that he was per- sonally reprimanded or threat- ened with dismissal at least 12 times in his.10-year career. teen-sixties as one of the agen-I But now, he said, he wantsjAdams has not received a pro- Gies leading experts on the to end his career.

The Government contends that because Dr. Ellsberg was given access to the Pentagon papers for his job at Rand- which had a contract with the Government-the violation - of the Rand security manual was, in fact, a violation of Govern- ment security regulations. The defense contends that Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo at most, violated the Rand Corporation's regulations, which would have. called for dismissal but littler else. '! At the end of today's session,: the prosecutor said that he be-' lieved that he could completer his cross-examination in aboutl an hour tomerrow, and the de- fense said that it could com- glete its redirect of Dr. Ellsberg by the end of the day. The Government's rebuttal case would then start on Thurs- day morning. During the morning session, Dr. Ellsberg insisted that he had not decided to copy the Pentagon papers until the morning of Sept. 30, 1969, when .he called his co- defendant, Anthony J. Russo Jr., and asked him if he could find a Xerox machine on which to do the copying. That night Inventory of Papers It is the contention of the defense that one set - of the Pentagon papers was purposely kept out of the Rand "top secret" security system be- cause those papers were in fact the private papers of Defensg Departments officials, -and that Dr. Ellsberg and Harry Rowen. then Rand's president, were the only ones who had access to them.) In April, -1969, Dr. Ellsberg said he was notified, that the Rand security system was hav- ing an inventory of all its of- ficially logged "top secret" papers. He asked Mr. - Rowen what to do with the Pentagon papers that he had in his own "top secret" safe, he said, and Mr. Rowen told him to put them in the President's safe until the inventory was over. Two of Mr. Rowen's secre- taries were aware that he was transferring them to Mr. Row- en's safe, he said. Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100140001-1 they started the Xeroxing. He also testified that when he picked up courier passes in March and August of that year to transport, first 10 volumes of the papers and then eight volumes, to Rand's Santa Mon- ica office from Rand's Washing- ton office, he did so in good faith, agreeing not to copy the papers that he later did copy. His answers were designed to defeat the Government's con- spiracy charge against the de- fendants. ' Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo are accused of six counts of espionage, six of theft and one count of conspiracy. Under cross-examination, Dr. Ellsberg told how he scurried about the corridors of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica in April will some of the volumes in a supermarket shop- ping cart to keep them from being discovered by Rand's security officers.

"Individual officers - an. economic counselor or a political counselor - would .look for opportunities.

A former U.S. ambassador to Chile has privately esti- mated that the far-flung covert program in Frei's be- half cost about $20 million. In contrast, the figure that emerged in Senate hearings as the amount ITT was will- ing to spend in 1970 to de- feat Allende was $1 million.

The first program loan in Latin America, a $40 million general economic develop- ment grant, was approved to buoy the Chilean economy, as the election approached. "We did not want to have a condition of vast unem- ployment as Chile was going into the election," recalled the former AID official. In addition to U.S. govern. ment asistance, Christian Democratic Party money was being funneled into Chile In Frei's behalf by the Ger- .man and Italian Christian Democratic parties. A m o n g the important channels were 'the German.

What the CIA sees, threatening about the, women's movement is, ,anybody's guess. The spy" agency can't be expected. to confirm or deny Mrs. Friedan's allegation. Good. ,spies don't.tell. The first report about the CIA and the women's movement was in a New York Times magazine arti- cle by Mrs. Friedan the. first part of March. It'was titled "Up From the Kitch- en Floor."

Miss Atkinson has an- nounced she is going to sue for $500,000 on ac- count of libel and slander.: After the Friedan article came out, Miss Atkinson and representatives of va- rious feminist groups, in-' eluding the National Women's Political Caucus, the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, held a press conference. They scored the Friedan article, es;>e= cially the reference to the CIA being behind disrup- tive elements of the move-, ment. But that didn't stop Mrs.- Friedan. About 10 days la- ter, she showed up -at a wine and cheese meeting at the New York apart- ment of Muriel Fox, chair- man of the board of the National Organization for Women and an executive at a New York public rela- tions agency.

In the interval, the corporation perhaps thought, the world had been' made safe for precisely the sort of old- fashioned economic imperialism-eor? porations expecting, their government to help them make money-that had gone out of style in the decades of the cold war. The very premise of the Church sub-` committee's look at ITT-CIA was that there is no longer an overarching na- tional security reason not to look One cannot imagine, for instance, a Senate committee looking three years after' 1964, or even noWV, at what the CIA' may have been up to in Chile In 1964:' Nor could one imagine, in an earlier period, that the CIA would let its dl.' rector, plus it top hand for dirty tricks in Latin America, testify before a Sen- ate committee. I am familiar with the "revisionist" 'discredit the entire wom- en's movement. In an interview, Miss A t k i n s o n said," Betty, pushed the wrong button this time." And in a copy- righted article in Majority Report, a feminist newspa- per serving the women of New York, Miss Atkinson replies to Mrs. Friedan. The article is titled: Betty Friedan, the CIA and Me, and in it Miss Atkinson says: "Betty Friedan'sarticle, Up From the Kitchen Floor . . is so riddled with lies that it is impossi.; ble fora feminist to make any sense out of it . ." She said the Friedan ar- ticle boils down to this: "Betty Friedan is the lead- er of the women's move- ment. All those other dis- reputables-issues such as prostitution, men as the enemy, marriage, moth- erhood, class and class s t r u c tures, lesbianism, sex, rape-are ideas plant- ed by the CIA and promul-, gated by agents and dupes thereof." argument that American foreign pol- icy, not only before World War II, but, afterwards, was dominated essentially by considerations of commerce: win- ning raw materials, markets, invest- ment privileges, and the like. The ar- gument seems to be persuasive only to' people who are already socialists or Marxists. My own view is that "political" considerations of power, status and fear were the stuff of the cold war. Granted, the notion that the world may now again be safe or ripe for old-` fashioned economic imperialism Is it rather Inflated conclusion to draw from the relatively' slender findings of the Senate inquiry Into ITT. Nor can it possibly be what everybody had in mind when they hoped that super-' power relations would begin to mel-' low. It would seem to be, nonetheless,, one of the possibilities deserving fur- ther scrutiny as we all strain to see what lies on the far side of the cold war. ..

So, American officials are pleased and surprised by the Bulgarian cooperation. One reason may be Bulgaria's concern over local hashish smoking. Unlike morphine base, the Middle East hash- ish is ready for use. Some of it circulates among young ,people in Sofia, and It is' also available at universities In Yugoslavia. American officials say that Bulgarian enforcement authorities are also angry at Western news articles that have described Bulgaria as a' "smugglers' paradise."

Previ- ously, communication was so poor that some persons who were arrested for drug offenses here were thought by relatives in the West to be missing. The Bulgarian customs service is well-esteemed. It is headed by Lazar Bonev, a handsome, middle-aged man who is said to have excellent' political connections in the, Bulgarian government. American officials are con- vinced that Bonev's service' is doing the best it can against tremendous odds. , "The smugglers we arrest. In Germany tell us that if, you make it through Bul- garia, you're clean," said % one American source. . The fact that many do, make it through attests to. the baffling task of enforce-. ment officials, which sortie, consider virtually lmpossi bile. The volume of traffic in the heroin pipeline is' overwhelming and growing. In 1970, 658,937 motoists crossed the Bulgarian bor-+ der in 162,138 vehicles. In the summer, the number of vehicles averages 8,000 to 10',000 a day. Many are driven by vacationers going .to or coming from Black Sea resort areas, and strict eon- trols could hurt vital tourist revenues. Sources say' that Austria is a favorite place for switching contraband from cars with Arab or Turkish li- cense plates or drivers to ones with West i German drivers and plates. This avoids suspicion at the West German, border, where con- trols are said to be the , toughest in Europe. Arabs and Turks are almost auto- matically searched carefully, sources connected with drug traffic controls say. In 1972, 2,300 kilograms (5,060 pounds) of morphine base were confiscated in the Stuttgart area. In the West German state of Bavaria, 416 persons-including 216 -Americans - were arrested for selling or transporting drugs. Southern Germany is a prime market for all kinds of drugs because the'largest contingent of the 300,000 American troops stationed in Europe is there. Some Western officials es- timate that half the mor- phine base used in the her- oin sold in American cities uses the main truck route from Istanbul, to Munich. This means that the bulk of It passes through ? the Turkish-Bulgarian border point at Kapikule. Even in winter, traffic there is heavy and inspec. tions on both sides of the border are necessarily cur- sory. West-bound lanes are crowded with trucks car- rying cargo to Western Eu- rope and the east-bound ones with trucks piled high with' washing machines and refrigerators that belong to Turkish workers returning from a tour in West Ger- man's booming industry. Besides the truck traffic, there 'are vacationers, tour- ists and workers from Yugo- slavia, Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.
